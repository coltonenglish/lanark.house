**Property Address:** 204 Langwell Common SE, Airdrie, AB
**Lot:** 1
**Block:** 13
**Model:** Fernie 3

The Lanark Landing Architectural Committee (the “Committee”), pursuant to the discretion granted in Section 10 of the Lanark Landing Architectural Guidelines (the “Guidelines”), hereby unilaterally waives the width requirement for the above-referenced property as defined in Section 3.2.2 of the Guidelines.  This waiver specifically addresses the 8-inch discrepancy between the as-built width of the home and the minimum width specified for the lot size.

Furthermore, this waiver serves to preemptively and unilaterally waive any future requirements or interpretations of the Guidelines that may arise concerning the width of the home on this specific property. This includes, but is not limited to, any subsequent amendments to the Guidelines or interpretations thereof that impose additional width restrictions or that reinterpret the definition of “width” as it applies to this property.

This waiver is granted in perpetuity and shall be binding upon the Committee and any subsequent architectural review boards or entities responsible for enforcing the Guidelines within Lanark Landing. This waiver shall run with the land and be binding upon all future owners of the property.

This waiver does not excuse any owner from compliance with all other applicable sections of the Guidelines, building codes, and other regulations.
