title: Waiver of Architectural Guideline 3.2.2 and Future Similar Requirements - Lanark

Below is an example of the type of waiver I was hoping for Melcor or the Architectural Committee to provide regarding the 8-inch difference in as-built vs required width of the property.

At this time, it seems the deal itself is dead in the water as Melcor has not called back and Trish Braun has indicated that she/Douglas Homes would not further pursue.

E2 and Associates has indicated they will give me a call back in the morning but at this time I feel that the material deficiency would be too great.  The material deficiency appears from my uneducated view that the 8-inches missing from the requisite dimensional width would prevent a bank from appropriately being able to resell at the value I'm supposed to request the loan for.  My understanding is that hoa restrictive covenants take priority over lenders'.

**Lot:** 1
**Block:** 13

The Lanark Landing Architectural Committee (the “Committee”), pursuant to the discretion granted in Section 10 of the Lanark Landing Architectural Guidelines (the “Guidelines”), hereby unilaterally waives the width requirement for the above-referenced property as defined in Section 3.2.2 of the Guidelines.  This waiver specifically addresses the 8-inch discrepancy between the as-built width of the home and the minimum width specified for the lot size.

Furthermore, this waiver serves to preemptively and unilaterally waive any future requirements or interpretations of the Guidelines that may arise concerning the width of the home on this specific property. This includes, but is not limited to, any subsequent amendments to the Guidelines or interpretations thereof that impose additional width restrictions or that reinterpret the definition of “width” as it applies to this property.

This waiver is granted in perpetuity and shall be binding upon the Committee and any subsequent architectural review boards or entities responsible for enforcing the Guidelines within Lanark Landing. This waiver shall run with the land and be binding upon all future owners of the property.

This waiver does not excuse any owner from compliance with all other applicable sections of the Guidelines, building codes, and other regulations.
