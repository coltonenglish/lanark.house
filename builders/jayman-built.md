My second attempt at purchasing a new home was with Jayman Built, and it served as a stark lesson in the importance of getting every detail in writing. The experience was defined by a dispute over a shower that was prominently featured in their marketing materials but was not included in the contract for our home at 71 Legacy Reach Court SE.

The core of the issue was that a premium, curbless, tiled shower, which we were led to believe was a standard feature, was later presented as a nearly $7,000 upgrade. This felt like a classic "bait and switch." When we tried to get clarity and have the agreed-upon specifications added to the contract, we were met with inconsistent information and long delays.

Communication with the sales team, including Brittney Mack and sales manager Michael Klassen, was frustrating and unproductive. Our attempts to escalate the issue were met with silence, and the dispute was never resolved. In the end, Jayman Built chose to terminate the purchase agreement rather than address our concerns.

This experience highlighted the dangers of relying on verbal agreements and the importance of ensuring that every single detail is clearly and accurately documented in the final contract.
