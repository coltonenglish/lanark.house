My experience with Douglas Homes was my first attempt at purchasing a new home and, unfortunately, it was a cautionary tale. The journey was fraught with red flags, the most significant of which was a profound lack of transparency from their salesperson, Trish Braun.

From the outset, there was a reluctance to provide a sample contract for review before signing. This was followed by a series of communication issues, including long delays in receiving requested information and a generally dismissive attitude. I also encountered inconsistencies in pricing and misrepresentations regarding HOA rules and restrictive covenants.

The deal-breaking issue was an 8-inch discrepancy in the plot plan. The builder was unwilling to seek a formal waiver from the developer to rectify this, which ultimately led to the collapse of the purchase agreement. To make matters worse, my legal name was incorrect on the contract, and the process to get it corrected was painstakingly slow.

Overall, the experience was deeply frustrating and left me feeling devalued as a customer. It taught me the importance of due diligence and of demanding transparency from a builder.
