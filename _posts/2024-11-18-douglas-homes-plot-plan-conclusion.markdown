I called Trish to follow up on the email I'd sent regarding the plot plan and my conversation with Erin at Melcor.  I wanted to understand why Douglas Homes wouldn't provide a written waiver confirming the house was plotted correctly on the land, especially given Melcor's willingness to have that conversation. Trish reiterated that head office wouldn't provide further documentation and that my options were to proceed with the purchase or accept a refund of my deposit.

I expressed my desire for transparency and emphasized that the call was being recorded. I explained my need to hold Douglas Homes accountable, rather than Trish personally, in case of misrepresentation.  Trish maintained her position and stated there would be no further discussion about the email's origin or the plot plan.

I tried to clarify that my request stemmed from a desire to mitigate future risks, not to accuse anyone of wrongdoing. I pointed out that the information I sought was outlined in the bylaws for the titled land and that Douglas Homes would be obligated to provide it to any purchaser.  Trish repeated that she had relayed my concerns to head office and they wouldn't provide additional information.

I reiterated that I was very happy with the plot itself, but wanted assurance that it adhered to all architectural guidelines. Trish confirmed that as far as she knew, based on conversations with the developer and the framing of the house, it did.

I acknowledged the sunk cost represented by the framing and emphasized that I was aiming to avoid any future issues. Trish stated that for the sale of the property, it was a non-issue and offered again to refund my deposit if I wasn't comfortable. She reiterated her unwillingness to continue discussing the topic further.

I thanked Trish for the information and said I would consider it and contact Melcor to confirm. Trish reminded me that while I was free to contact Erin, the proper process was to communicate through Douglas Homes. She added that Erin had already stated she had nothing further to provide.

I expressed that I felt Trish was feeling attacked, which wasn't my intention. I explained that I was trying to ensure a positive experience for everyone and that my request for written confirmation was simply a matter of due diligence. Trish suggested I take the evening to make a final decision and inform her.  She also mentioned that if I chose to cancel, I would be provided with a "non-waiver" document to terminate the contract and protect my interests.

I thanked Trish and ended the call.
