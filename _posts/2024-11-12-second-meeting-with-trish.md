I met with Trish in person to sign the purchase contract. I brought my passport for identification, as my driver's license had been recently lost while traveling in Estonia.  Trish took a photo of it for verification. I confirmed my initial $5000 bank draft was received and asked for a PDF of the contract via DocuSign so I could review and highlight it before signing. Trish agreed and said she would send it shortly.

We discussed the remaining deposit.  Trish explained that Douglas Homes would take the initial $5000 and then the balance of the 10% deposit after the conditions were waived, which would be ten business days from the contract date. This would be detailed in the contract.  I confirmed I had pre-approvals from multiple lenders and Trish stated that as long as I had an approval in place at the time of waiving conditions, the specific lender didn't matter to Douglas Homes.

We discussed upgrades. Trish confirmed the pricing for tile in the walk-in closet was around $720.  We agreed to add the tile upgrade to the contract. I also inquired about adding Cat 6 wiring, and Trish said she'd provide more information later.

We reviewed HOA restrictions. Trish assured me there were no restrictions on security cameras. Any issues would fall under city bylaws. We also confirmed there were no restrictions on fire pits, unless it was a fire ban, again under city bylaws.  She confirmed the fence height restriction was the primary HOA concern, and there was nothing else I needed to be aware of.

Trish confirmed that there were no restrictive covenants after Melcor left, and maintenance of parks, streets, and boulevards would fall to the city of Airdrie until they were turned over to Airdrie.

I expressed concerns about the setbacks and landscaping. I noted that finished corner lots often had a masonry cap on the fences, unlike mine. Trish explained that the stone detailing was required for townhomes on main roads, but not for my lot, as it wasn't visible from a main street.

We discussed the potential impact of discrepancies between the house plan and the architectural guidelines, specifically regarding setbacks. Trish reassured me that Douglas Homes handled setback regulations with Melcor during the plotting phase, and any issues there would have been flagged before construction started. She confirmed they wouldn't have received a permit otherwise.

We also discussed the possibility of changing lenders after waiving conditions, which Trish confirmed was not a problem as long as financing was secured.

I inquired about the location of the gas line for a future barbecue. We agreed to add a gas line to the back of the house for approximately $300, placed as close to the end of the deck as allowed.

Trish asked about the placement of Cat 6 outlets. We agreed on three upgrades on the main floor: one in the flex room, one above the fireplace in the great room, and one in the primary bedroom. We agreed to add two in the basement bedrooms, one closer to the closet and one to be confirmed once I provided wall measurements. We also agreed to upgrade the cat 5 wiring in the flex room and great room to cat 6.

Trish confirmed the appliance package included an electric stove and that a gas line was not available except for the furnace. I confirmed I was fine with an electric stove.

We discussed the timeline for completion and possession. Trish said she would try to get as much information as possible from the electrician and other trades to include in the contract, such as cost estimates for Cat 6 wiring.  She said she would mark the locations on the brochure.

We discussed options for the walk-through.  Trish said she would check with Paul, the site supervisor, about the timing for the walkthrough to occur after electrical and plumbing but before drywall. She would contact me as soon as insulation was scheduled. If Paul wasn't available, she or her assistant would do the walk-through with me.

I asked about the concrete pad listed on the plans and Trish said she would have to look at the blueprints to clarify if it referred to the sidewalk.  I also noted a chimney was indicated on the plans for corner lots but not on my home. Trish said this was likely an aesthetic detail and offered to show me the blueprints when her computer finished rebooting.

We discussed the process and timeline for the walkthrough. Trish said that she would make a note to contact me once insulation was scheduled, so we could arrange the walkthrough for shortly before drywall was installed.

I had questions about the process going forward.  Trish explained that she would prepare the contract, which was about 10 pages long, and would include two schedules detailing the specifications and upgrades. Schedule B would include any custom options, and the price for hardwood in the flexroom, which would increase the purchase price.

Trish also confirmed the contract would state that I could visit Trail Appliances to select or upgrade appliances after the sale was firm, that the washer and dryer were not included, and that the purchase contract included information about the R-value of insulation, etc.  She also said she would send the plot plan, but was not able to share the blueprints due to copyright restrictions.

I asked about the dimensions of the lot, noting that my house appeared narrower than other Ferny 3 models.  Trish agreed to check into it, as well as the price of changing the flex room from carpet to hardwood.  She also confirmed the garage door would be double doors and would include glass.  Finally, she confirmed the basement ceiling height is eight feet.
