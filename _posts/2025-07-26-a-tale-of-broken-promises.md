The search for a new home is a journey of details. It’s in the quiet moments of imagining your life in a new space that the little things—a window with a perfect view, a kitchen layout that feels just right—become the anchors of your decision. For me, one of those details was an ensuite shower. It might sound small, but it was a feature that represented a touch of luxury and a personal sanctuary in what I hoped would be my new home at 71 Legacy Reach Court SE, a property by Jayman Built.

The process began with a spark of excitement. In early March 2025, I received the purchase agreement. The conversations leading up to this point had been positive, and I was particularly excited about the ensuite shower, which had been described as a spacious 75-inch glass enclosure. It was a detail that stuck with me, a feature I was looking forward to.

However, when the contract arrived, that detail was missing. It was a small omission, but it was enough to give me pause. I reached out to clarify, and what followed was a series of conversations that slowly turned my initial excitement into a lesson in communication and the importance of getting every detail in writing.

Over the next few weeks, I tried to get the shower specification added to the contract. I exchanged emails and calls with the sales team, hoping for a quick resolution. But as time went on, the process stalled. My attempts to get clarity were met with delays and, eventually, silence. The shower, which had started as a symbol of my excitement, was now becoming a source of frustration.

The situation highlighted a crucial lesson for any homebuyer: the details that matter to you should matter to your builder. When they don’t, it’s a sign that something is wrong. The experience taught me that a home is more than just a structure; it’s a place where you should feel heard and respected, even before you move in.

In the end, the discrepancy over the shower was never resolved. In early May, Jayman decided to terminate the purchase agreement, and the dream of my new home at Legacy Reach Court came to an end. The experience was disappointing, but it was also clarifying. It reinforced the importance of transparency and the need for clear, consistent communication from start to finish.

For anyone on a similar journey, my advice is this: pay attention to the details that matter to you, and don’t be afraid to advocate for them. A home is a significant investment, not just financially, but emotionally. Make sure you’re building it on a foundation of trust and clear communication.
