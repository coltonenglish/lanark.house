I called Trish with questions regarding the PDF document she'd sent. I noted that the document, while e-signed by DW, lacked the typical DocuSign "envelope" which includes authorization and verification information. I wanted to confirm the document's validity for my bank. Trish stated that the signature process was standard and asked what additional information I required.  I explained that I needed the authorization details typically included in a DocuSign package, particularly the verification steps.  Trish said she was unfamiliar with that and that she'd sold hundreds of homes using the current process without issue.

I acknowledged this but explained that this particular purchase was more complex due to the eight-inch discrepancy and my need for transparency with the bank. I wanted to ensure they understood the potential implications of the discrepancy, even though Trish had provided assurances in writing. I explained my concern that the HOA or architectural committee could have a superseding caveat on the title, potentially impacting the ability to collect in case of default, should the eight inches ever be challenged.  Therefore, I wanted full transparency upfront.

Trish stated that she had raised my concerns with her office and reiterated that the home was framed according to the plot plan, which had been approved.  She believed there was nothing more she could provide.

I expressed my appreciation for her written assurances but reiterated my concern about Melcor potentially wanting those eight inches back or a future HOA raising the issue. Trish insisted Melcor wouldn't come back on the issue, as Douglas Homes had submitted plans and a plot plan to the city, which had been approved.

I acknowledged her point but reiterated that the final approval document I had received placed responsibility on the builder to check restrictive covenants.  I questioned if Melcor was being intentionally ambiguous to give themselves an out. Trish stated she didn't know the answers to my questions as it wasn't within her purview as a sales representative.

I then brought up the DocuSign issue again, noting that the emails and documents had come from a personal email address. I asked Trish if she was an employee or contractor of Douglas Homes, explaining that this impacted who would be liable for the statements made. Trish stated that she represents Douglas Homes.  I asked again to clarify, and she confirmed she works for Douglas Homes.

I then started to ask about materially false statements and liability, but Trish interrupted to explain she was about to start a client meeting and was running late due to weather.  She asked to postpone the conversation.

I agreed, stating that I wanted to finish my thought.  I expressed my appreciation for Trish’s helpful and clear written responses regarding the eight-inch issue and Melcor, then asked again about the numbered corporation used for the DocuSign and if she was an employee of Douglas Homes.  She said she’d have to call me back as she was walking into her client meeting.  I agreed to her calling back. She called back almost immediately and I confirmed that we would continue the conversation later.  I thanked her for answering and we ended the call.

I called Trish to thank her for documenting my concerns and to follow up on the wording in her email which stated that the plot plan issue wasn't something I needed to be involved in.  I wanted confirmation that this wording came directly from Douglas Homes. My goal was to ensure I was protected from any future issues with the architectural committee or HOA regarding the eight-inch discrepancy.

Trish confirmed the wording in her email was from head office. She explained that Douglas Homes is responsible for submitting exterior colors, elevations, and plot plans for approval by both the city and the developer. Since Douglas Homes owns the land, they must adhere to all rules and regulations, which they've done. Therefore, there's nothing for the purchaser to worry about.  She emphasized this wasn't glossing over the issue, but stating there was genuinely nothing for me, or any purchaser, to deal with because construction wouldn't have started otherwise.

I asked if she could forward the email from head office, but she clarified it was a verbal discussion.  She offered to have someone from head office put it in writing, but wanted clarification on the specific wording I desired.

I explained the ideal solution would be for Douglas Homes to obtain a waiver for the eight-inch discrepancy as outlined in Section 10 of the architectural guidelines.  This would protect me in perpetuity and eliminate any further discussion.  Trish said she would have to ask about the waiver process as it wasn't something she normally dealt with. She also clarified that since this wasn't a pre-sale but a spec home, the price was fixed and couldn't change.  She acknowledged that in pre-sales there might be additional costs for things like retaining walls, but those are dealt with before a spec home is sold.  She offered to accept an email from me with the precise wording I wanted and forward it to Douglas Homes.

I thanked Trish, and reiterated that having written documentation, especially if e-signed or printed as a semi-audible document, would put my mind at ease.  I explained that my concern stemmed from my experience living in a condo with strict regulations. Trish understood my anxiety but assured me that with a single-family home and HOA, there wasn't another governing body to restrict me in the same way. She encouraged me to email her the desired wording.

I thanked her again and we briefly discussed my other question regarding liability. I explained I'd rather deal directly with Douglas Homes if any issues arise, rather than Trish's LLC. Trish clarified that any issues would be between me and Douglas Homes, the company she works for, not her personally. I acknowledged this but expressed concern that her working under a separate LLC might complicate matters, and I reiterated my preference to address issues directly with Douglas Homes. Trish reaffirmed her role as sales facilitator for Douglas Homes.  I said I would send the email, thanked her again and ended the call.
