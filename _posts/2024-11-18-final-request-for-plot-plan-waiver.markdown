I called Trish to thank her for documenting my concerns and to follow up on the wording in her email which stated that the plot plan issue wasn't something I needed to be involved in.  I wanted confirmation that this wording came directly from Douglas Homes. My goal was to ensure I was protected from any future issues with the architectural committee or HOA regarding the eight-inch discrepancy.

Trish confirmed the wording in her email was from head office. She explained that Douglas Homes is responsible for submitting exterior colors, elevations, and plot plans for approval by both the city and the developer. Since Douglas Homes owns the land, they must adhere to all rules and regulations, which they've done. Therefore, there's nothing for the purchaser to worry about.  She emphasized this wasn't glossing over the issue, but stating there was genuinely nothing for me, or any purchaser, to deal with because construction wouldn't have started otherwise.

I asked if she could forward the email from head office, but she clarified it was a verbal discussion.  She offered to have someone from head office put it in writing, but wanted clarification on the specific wording I desired.

I explained the ideal solution would be for Douglas Homes to obtain a waiver for the eight-inch discrepancy as outlined in Section 10 of the architectural guidelines.  This would protect me in perpetuity and eliminate any further discussion.  Trish said she would have to ask about the waiver process as it wasn't something she normally dealt with. She also clarified that since this wasn't a pre-sale but a spec home, the price was fixed and couldn't change.  She acknowledged that in pre-sales there might be additional costs for things like retaining walls, but those are dealt with before a spec home is sold.  She offered to accept an email from me with the precise wording I wanted and forward it to Douglas Homes.

I thanked Trish, and reiterated that having written documentation, especially if e-signed or printed as a semi-audible document, would put my mind at ease.  I explained that my concern stemmed from my experience living in a condo with strict regulations. Trish understood my anxiety but assured me that with a single-family home and HOA, there wasn't another governing body to restrict me in the same way. She encouraged me to email her the desired wording.

I thanked her again and we briefly discussed my other question regarding liability. I explained I'd rather deal directly with Douglas Homes if any issues arise, rather than Trish's LLC. Trish clarified that any issues would be between me and Douglas Homes, the company she works for, not her personally. I acknowledged this but expressed concern that her working under a separate LLC might complicate matters, and I reiterated my preference to address issues directly with Douglas Homes. Trish reaffirmed her role as sales facilitator for Douglas Homes.  I said I would send the email, thanked her again and ended the call.
