This repository and site serve as a way to document and inventory every step of my new home purchase process.

## The Journey

My home-buying journey involved three distinct phases with three different builders. The correct chronological order is: Douglas Homes -> Jayman Built -> Sterling Homes.

### 1. Douglas Homes (Late 2024)

This was the **first** unsuccessful purchase attempt.

*   **Key Contact:** Trish Braun
*   **Issues:** This experience was defined by a lack of transparency and communication challenges.
    *   The builder's representative refused to provide a sample contract for review prior to signing.
    *   There were misrepresentations regarding the HOA rules and restrictive covenants.
    *   A major conflict arose over an 8-inch plot plan discrepancy between the architectural guidelines and the as-built property.
    *   The builder was unwilling to seek a formal waiver for this discrepancy from the developer (Melcor) or the architectural committee (E2 and Associates), leading to the deal's collapse in November 2024.

### 2. Jayman Built (Early 2025)

This was the **second** unsuccessful purchase attempt, which took place in the community of **Legacy**.

*   **Property:** 71 Legacy Reach Court SE
*   **Issues:** The core of this dispute was a contract discrepancy.
    *   The purchase agreement, received around March 4, 2025, did not include the larger, upgraded ensuite shower that had been verbally discussed and agreed upon.
    *   Attempts to resolve this discrepancy and get the desired feature formally added to the contract were unsuccessful, leading to the second collapsed deal.
    *   Meticulous records of this attempt are stored in the "Legacy House (archived)" folder on Google Drive.

### 3. Sterling Homes (Mid-2025)

This was the **final and successful** purchase.

*   **Property:** 728 Langley Terrace
*   **Key Contact:** Jason Tang (lanark@sterlingcalgary.com)
*   **Timeline:**
    *   **May 3, 2025:** Initial contact and information received.
    *   **May 21, 2025:** Mortgage approval secured with CIBC (after also engaging with ATB).
    *   **May 28, 2025:** Home inspection completed.
    *   **June 2, 2025:** Closing date.
*   **Positive Outcomes:** This experience was a significant improvement over the previous two.
    *   The process was collaborative and transparent.
    *   The final home was more affordable than the Jayman property.
    *   It included key desired features like a full-height tile bathroom and a front garage.
    *   The quick-possession timeline was a major advantage, allowing the user to move in far sooner than if they had proceeded with either of the other two builders.
