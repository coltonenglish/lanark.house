## Project Status

**Overall Goal:** Create 2-3 long-form blog posts for each of the three builders (Douglas Homes, Jayman Built, Sterling Homes) detailing the user's home-buying experience. The posts should be written in the persona of "Colton English" but revised to be less self-referential and more focused on the universal lessons for a new home buyer.

**Progress:**

1.  **Initial Drafts Created:** I have generated two draft blog posts for each of the three builders.
2.  **Tone Revision Initiated:** Based on user feedback, I have begun revising the posts to have a more inviting tone that avoids sounding narcissistic, while still reflecting a detail-oriented perspective.
    *   **Douglas Homes:** Both posts (`a-tale-of-red-flags-and-transparency.md` and `the-8-inch-divide.md`) have been revised and the files updated.
    *   **Jayman Built:** The first post (`a-tale-of-two-contracts.md`) has been revised and the file updated.

**Next Steps:**

1.  **Revise Jayman Built Post #2:** Revise the second post about the Jayman Built experience (`_drafts/house/jayman-built/a-tale-of-broken-promises.md`) to align with the new tone.
2.  **Revise Sterling Homes Posts:** Revise the two posts about the Sterling Homes experience (`a-tale-of-three-builders-the-sterling-experience.md` and `the-unveiled-reality-of-homeownership.md`).
3.  **Commit New Files:** Once all revisions are complete, add and commit the six new blog post files to the repository.
