[Speaker 1]
I just want to take a second to, uh. Really get down the narrative as to how I feel about purchasing a house or anything over like that. You know, honestly, the 15, 20, 000 Mark is like? Yeah, pretty extreme. Um, but I think? Uh, especially when we come to.

[Speaker 1]
Like?

[Speaker 1]
Two hundred thousand, three hundred thousand. We start talking about multiple years of somebody's life. That is. Committed to a purchase. So specifically, this is obviously, um. Specifically, and obviously, this is talking about my house purchase. Um, with a 620 000 house purchase. Um. You know, I'm making a 30-year commitment. I've shifted from being able to pay off my mortgage in, you know? By the time I'm 38, I could pay off my my condo mortgage in three years. If I did, absolutely everything as aggressively as possible. Or, um, you know, less than? 11 years at my current rate.

[Speaker 1]
Um to. I've now adopted another 30-year commitment. Um, so with that 30-year commitment, I think. Um. You know? There's the negotiation of cost and. You know that puts in objective material value? Um, that you you need to have when you're, you know, trying to Hegel and and? Discuss, but you also need to have in like an internal vision of what that cost is. Um, because you know, 620, 000 internally. Probably just sounds like a number right, and it's just it's semantically nothing. So, for me, it becomes the 30 years. What is 30 years of my life worth?

[Speaker 1]
Um, what am I? What am I trading those 30 years worth? Um. And, uh, yeah, so? Uh, as I kind of move forward and approach this, um.

It's, uh, it's very, very important to me that, um. That I am getting that, like, 30 years. Properly returned to me when I purchase it. So, I need to feel safe. I need to feel comfortable. It needs to service my needs. Um. And like. You know, I don't think that customers should be abusive to sales people.

Um, but certainly. Um. Buying a house should not feel like entering a dollar store. So, there's a lot of. Entitlement. I think when I've dealt with people in this industry. Um and. The home purchase process. Obviously, Trish comes to mind, absolutely worthless. Human, just just total garbage, um? Blase couldn't care less.

Whether you buy with her or not? Um, she just feels entitled to the money that comes to her when she makes a sale. Um. That should not be the case that should never be the experience. Um. It should feel like you are getting that 30 years worth of comfort and security.

Um, ideally, more, right, like? Mentally, you're probably treating it like an investment, um, you know, even if you sell you, you need to understand that it's. You know that that? If it's gonna a house that's gonna dilapidate and deteriorate at 30 years, then you need to be counting in for appreciation.

So you really, ideally, want to be buying something that is, you know? 50, 60, 70 year? Home. Um, and have confidence in it. Um, so things like my house, uh, that I've purchased has 50-year tiles supposedly. Um, that's exciting. To me, that's a, that's a very meaningful addition. Um.

But then, you know, obviously, I put a review that wasn't so great about a guy named Mike, uh, that did the walkthroughs with me. Um. And, you know, and again, very blase, very frustrating for me to be, like, hey, I'm I'm offering, you know, I'm trading 30 years of my life?

Uh, and you're just being apathetic. Um, and it really comes down to an exchange of time for a exchange of security. Um. So? Yeah.
