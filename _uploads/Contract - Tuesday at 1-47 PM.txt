[Speaker 1]
Follow.

[Speaker 2]
I'm sorry. I have face blindness, are you? You're Trish right?

[Speaker 1]
I am. Okay.

[Speaker 2]
I thought I was going to come and sign the papers today.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, sorry. Yeah, we don't open YouTube. They don't have anything ready for you. So it'll take me a few minutes. I'm just gonna eat Molly when I got into the office. Okay. That, um, so okay. Okay.

[Speaker 2]
Are you able to just like, send me a PDF of the documents?

[Speaker 1]
Looking at your leisurable through everything. That's typically what I do, but I'm also more than happy to sit down and go through that to the person. What would you offer?

[Speaker 2]
Um, Docu's line is fine. As long as I can. Like download it and go through and highlight it off offline. Okay, yeah, okay.

[Speaker 1]
Um, I mean some people. It's what you get. It's just a personal preference, right? Okay. Well I never rush anyone when we're doing it in person. We kind of have to go through and assign it. Whereas if we have it at home, we can you know, kind of look through it. If you have any questions about any of the Clauses or anything you can.

[Speaker 2]
Yep.

[Speaker 1]
So all I will need so wait, we can come in with me, okay?

[Speaker 1]
Sorry, I didn't

[Speaker 2]
Mean to Ambush you. I I thought you guys were open from like noon or something.

[Speaker 1]
Worries, not a problem.

[Speaker 3]
There we go. System is disarmed.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, so

[Speaker 4]
We have a seat. So if I'm going to drop it and send it to you, I will just need a couple of things, okay? In

[Speaker 2]
Order to do

[Speaker 4]
That, Um, you drove here so I assume you have your driver's license

[Speaker 2]
Plate. No. It was in another country. I do have a passport as long as it

[Speaker 4]
Is. Government issued ID, that is

[Speaker 2]
I made it 20 days without losing anything and then on the last day, I getting on the bus somehow.

[Speaker 4]
Seriously everyone in the country?

[Speaker 2]
Yeah.

[Speaker 4]
Oh dear. I thought you were joking. What country did you lose it?

[Speaker 2]
Uh Estonia. Oh

[Speaker 4]
Wow. Well that's

[Speaker 2]
It's like a very small towns. So somebody I knew found it and they're like, oh that's cool. So it's not

[Speaker 5]
Someone's still in your identity. No,

[Speaker 2]
No. It's in the mail actually. But oh, that's crazy. Estonia,

[Speaker 4]
Is there a reason for your travels there? Just out of curiosity. Oh, New York work. Gotcha. Are you okay? If I take a picture of this, I'll delete it once I'm done. But I have to provide it to the office. So they Identity and all that.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, make sure I have it all. Okay, so, that's first thing. Awesome, thank you for that. I have your initial five thousand dollar bank draft. Of course,

[Speaker 2]
I did not

[Speaker 4]
Submit it to head office, I don't do that until they have a contract to go with it. Otherwise they're like, what is this for? So, I will do that. Um, I don't think we talked about Deposits other than your initial one. So typically, Douglas would take that. And then when you wave your conditions, which is 10 business days from, let's say today, if I date it for today, we would take the balance of 10 percent,

[Speaker 2]
Okay? So that will be

[Speaker 4]
In the contract. You'll see it. It'll have first deposit, 5000, second deposit again, that balance making it 10 of the, the purchase price. Okay?

[Speaker 2]
So that'll be broken

[Speaker 4]
Down in the contract for you. Is what they like me to do is that I assume you have a pre-approval. We didn't really get into that discussion.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I have pre-approvals. Um, Yeah, I have multiple pre-approvals. Okay. But so

[Speaker 4]
Whoever you decide to use, that's fine. Yeah. As long as um, you have a approval that you're happy with wave conditions if you because I mean it's still under construction. If three months from now, you decide to change blenders. I mean that's your prerogative, okay? We don't

[Speaker 2]
Care

[Speaker 4]
Who you use as long as you have an approval in place, okay? Or multi. So that's one thing I need, okay? And different. There's a difference between

[Speaker 2]
Pre-approval and approval. Appree approval. Well, I mean that's

[Speaker 4]
Up to you at the Comfort level. I always want to make sure you're safe, anybody's, safe when you waive conditions, because then you are in a contract, right? So but I mean, if you want to wait, Interest rates are dropping all that kind of stuff. I mean, it depends who you're using, but they can usually give you the lower rate obviously, Whatever is less right? Your current pre-approval rate or whatever is current at the time

[Speaker 2]
So that's fine.

[Speaker 4]
I don't need anything formal from them. Okay.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah I just need to make

[Speaker 4]
Sure you're okay. Okay. Uh the other thing is so with the Uh, I'm trying to think because I don't have all of the I do have the pricing for the tile in your walk-in closet is that something that you want to add, then, um, Because I would have to put this in the contract, that's why I'm asking.

[Speaker 2]
And it's about 6 000 for full Hardwood versus what was the the tile 800?

[Speaker 4]
I know, I just have to request pricing from my office and then they send it back to me. Um, so when I asked them,

[Speaker 2]
Sorry,

[Speaker 4]
Bear with me while it's getting that round. Rainbow ball of Doom.

[Speaker 2]
So then we talked about the HOA, you, you're pretty sure there's nothing up with security cameras. Um, that would if

[Speaker 4]
There was ever anything that was the only thing I can possibly think of is a neighbor feeling intrusive. That would be bylaw. Maybe a city that has nothing to do with, you know, restrictions on whether or not you can have Security canvas is my is my point.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, what about like fire pits or anything like that? Okay,

[Speaker 4]
Unless there's a fire ban again, that's all City, because it's not a condom. So you own the land. Like I said, the only restriction that I've been told is again because you're doing your own landscaping, the height of your fence, and that would be the same in any Community within, you know, within, uh, With an air jury recovery, right? So No, fire pitch, hot tub, and it's It's your it's your loudest. You know, there's no restrictions in that regard, okay.

[Speaker 2]
Um, So is it like there's no restrictive Covenant whatsoever after melchor's gone? No, no, then

[Speaker 4]
It would fall to the city of her dream, of course to maintain, you know, the the parks and the streets and the boulevards and all that kind of stuff until that big. They're completely finished in the community and they turn it over to Airdrie. Then Melport would be responsible for maintaining those Those spaces, okay.

[Speaker 2]
And then, And so the fence. For sure. Nothing, right? Yeah. Because you

[Speaker 4]
Could do events. Yes. My. I

[Speaker 2]
Guess my concern is every I was just there and I was driving around. I could not find a single finished corner lot that didn't have an identical like 12 by 12 Mason recap on it. Well, they're

[Speaker 4]
On the main roads. Um, like you probably saw our before you turn in to go to where the duplex is and where your home is. Yeah. Um, the development we had to do that stone. The fence to our town home

[Speaker 2]
Serum and, you know,

[Speaker 4]
But but because this is not, yes, it's a corner of a street, but it's not visible from a Main Street, right? It's just a big circle. Yeah. Cul-asac in a way, right? Um, so no, I have not heard of any restrictions as far as what you can do, other than hiked. Okay,

[Speaker 2]
So and like, setbacks and all that. Like, I guess does if, if melcor is like, hey, this doesn't match our architectural guidelines who How does that play out? Like, obviously that will set back. Um, That will set back my ability to take possession as you guys fix that. But then, do does our contract change at all, or do you guys fix that? So are

[Speaker 4]
You talking about fencing and Landscaping and stuff

[Speaker 2]
Fencing? Landscaping setbacks. So that's all after

[Speaker 4]
You take possession, obviously, right? So it wouldn't be Douglas, it would be dealing with any of that because you owe meant to be your house,

[Speaker 2]
Right?

[Speaker 4]
So but I mean

[Speaker 2]
Like so right now the the rules are that a 30 foot Needs to have a 20-foot property on it. This is a 19.4 or 19. Are you

[Speaker 4]
Talking about set back from the street? Yeah,

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. So

[Speaker 4]
That's something that the Builder has to deal with when they plot the home on the lawn.

[Speaker 2]
Correct. So, that's already

[Speaker 4]
Been dealt with. You don't have to worry about anything like that, okay? So any sort of, you know, regulations with setback and stuff, would have been something that Douglas Holmes in this case would have dealt with melkora.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. So

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, and if

[Speaker 2]
Milk or is ever like well that

[Speaker 4]
Would be a double, they wouldn't have allowed us to get a permit. Okay. So you

[Speaker 2]
Guys have building the home. Okay, cool. So the Just says it's preferred that you guys get approval beforehand, but it didn't say that like melkor must give approval beforehand. So I've just, I don't know because

[Speaker 4]
I don't know, I sell the houses. I don't deal with all that kind of stuff, but in my experience, um, any build driver for multiple Builders over the years, that's some no homeowner no. Purchaser, has to deal with that kind of stuff, right? That's not anything you need to worry about. Okay. So and it's already under construction. Yeah. So I mean there's no issues there. The only time I ever had, it's only been an issue, but the home was already being I'm in Evanston and there was a a side yard. They had intruded onto the side yard. So someone did make an error with with the foundation so they had to move things around and stuff. But again, nothing to do with the purchaser that was between the Builder that was between the city and between the developer.

[Speaker 2]
Yep. Uh, and

[Speaker 4]
So no cost to that individual, but

[Speaker 2]
That's all I want to know is like if if oh

[Speaker 4]
No because you know nothing to do now. When we talk about future stuff like your Landscaping and your fencing again, you own the land, not condo, you can do whatever you want, you can't build a 10-foot fence, like I mentioned Make the developer might have something to say but I doubt it you own the land but sometimes they do keep those architectural controls in place until they're done in the community. So if you moved in and wanted to completely change your siding color to something crazy, you couldn't, you'd have to get authorization from it.

[Speaker 2]
But as if

[Speaker 4]
You're going to do that, you're not going to spend thousands and thousands of dollars to change your sighting to something, they wouldn't like this. So in an extreme case that's that's all that you would have to worry about,

[Speaker 2]
Okay. Uh with that

[Speaker 4]
Kind

[Speaker 6]
Of

[Speaker 4]
Stuff. So, I was just looking up, sorry the cost. Did you have it in your email that you had sent with your questions?

[Speaker 2]
Uh, yeah. It was 80 in one.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah. So so

[Speaker 2]
What I would

[Speaker 4]
Do in the contract is I put that cost that was given to me from head office.

[Speaker 2]
Uh I just

[Speaker 4]
Put I will put upgrade to to tile

[Speaker 2]
In

[Speaker 4]
The walk-in closet. They gave me the square footage. I have a

[Speaker 2]
Oh for the tile. Yeah, I wasn't even thinking about that one. Um,

[Speaker 4]
Is that something you want to do?

[Speaker 2]
This is so weird with the carpet.

[Speaker 4]
You're looking at your model. I mean, I've never done it before, truthfully. No one's done that. But in looking at your model because it's off of the, the yeah, it's

[Speaker 2]
Just going to be like one square of.

[Speaker 4]
It's not, it won't be weird. I think it would be fine. It would flow fine, like for future resale or yeah, but

[Speaker 2]
It's

[Speaker 4]
Entirely up to you.

[Speaker 2]
What was the price for that? Um,

[Speaker 4]
Man, hang on. I was just

[Speaker 4]
Sorry. Oh,

[Speaker 2]
720.

[Speaker 4]
I got it entirely up to you. You could just put a plastic, you know, like a almost like a floor mat for a car there. You know what I mean? Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Honestly, it's not even so much the floor, it's just the general humidity humidity of the area. So it's like the the better approach would be. If if I could get you guys to put like a, uh, air exchanger in the

[Speaker 6]
In

[Speaker 2]
The closet so that it pulls the air into the

[Speaker 4]
The other thing is you'd have to get in your own again after you move in them, you know, you can get a small dehumidifier or something but unfortunately that's not anything. And there's

[Speaker 2]
No outlets in those closets there.

[Speaker 4]
It's, it's a code thing.

[Speaker 2]
Really

[Speaker 4]
They never put donuts in walk-in closets. If it's a walk through, just like if you have a pantry, there's never an outlet in there. But if it's a walk-through Pantry, then they can

[Speaker 2]
Interesting did not know that. Yeah. Um,

[Speaker 4]
So it's up to you. Uh, if we don't add it now, and you say a month, you know, a month from now on, maybe not that long. Ideally, um, Oh, I wanted well

[Speaker 2]
Within 10 days, you can get it,

[Speaker 4]
But you would have to pay cash. Okay, out of your pocket, that's fine or whatever. I just want to make sure I don't, you know, want you to be out.

[Speaker 2]
That actually sounds. And

[Speaker 4]
The other thing, of course, was adding the cat six. I know the initial info. You would ask for and then the most recent info in your questions. I have forwarded. But I mean, I don't, I'm not I was going to email you today. When I got here saying, I'm probably not going to have all these details before you want to make your decision. Yeah, so

[Speaker 2]
I'll try to get

[Speaker 4]
As much info. It's just my office is going to the electrician, who, you know, is it is a, is a guy who isn't always, you know, as quick as responding as maybe we would like, that's all right. So, I'll absolutely get as much info as I can, but I won't have, That for today.

[Speaker 2]
Is the electrician. I guess you said you didn't know. I don't even know

[Speaker 4]
Because I don't deal with. You know, I don't deal directly with the trades, right? I can talk to my site server and try to see if he knows. He's very, he's not an electrician. But I mean, he's well versed. In lots of areas, obviously of construction, I can chat with him today. His name's Paul, he can fill me in on the questions you ask, if he knows. Um, but to that, the reason I bring that up too, of course, I know it's important to you. Um, is we wouldn't want to add Add those. Okay, of course in the contract and as I mentioned in my answers, there we would mark on the brochure where we want them, okay so that's the process that Douglas.

[Speaker 4]
First thing to do. So what I would do

[Speaker 2]
Down here And what are the existing connection points? I know the one above the the weird. I know the weird one which

[Speaker 4]
Which weird one. Sorry,

[Speaker 2]
There's the desk one which

[Speaker 5]
In

[Speaker 4]
The kitchen. Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
The one, the desk that shouldn't be a desk.

[Speaker 4]
The

[Speaker 2]
Breakfast nook, one.

[Speaker 4]
So many of our townhomes duplexes and single family have that area? Yes, there is one there. Okay.

[Speaker 2]
And then there's a, there's a coaxial and ethernet both above the fireplace, right? Okay. Is there one already in the flex room?

[Speaker 4]
There is one already in the flexor.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. So that's an upgrade. Okay.

[Speaker 4]
So

[Speaker 2]
It's three and three, then. That's okay, so we would upgrade

[Speaker 4]
The The five to a six in the flex room.

[Speaker 2]
Yep. We would upgrade

[Speaker 4]
The five to a six in the great room above the fireplace

[Speaker 2]
And

[Speaker 4]
We would upgrade this from a five to a second. So we're just upgrading three on the main is that right? Yep.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. And then

[Speaker 4]
In the primary bedroom your bedroom. There is a fine. There is a five.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, we don't

[Speaker 4]
Read that to six. Okay, what about bedroom? Two and three? Do you want to add a six?

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. Where do you want them?

[Speaker 4]
Like here and here or do

[Speaker 2]
Try to picture if

[Speaker 2]
This is the bigger one. If we can do here. Middle of the wall on the, I guess that's the east side. Or yeah. Sorry the west side. Um, And this one doesn't. Matter so much we'll just say, I'm, you know, closer to the closet.

[Speaker 4]
Okay. Yeah. The elections the electrician is going to put as close as he can to where we Market, but I mean within, you know, within a stud. Yeah, yeah, exactly. So what I'll do now, that I know that, um, I'd like to have everything done and dusted with the contract. So as to save you having to pay out of pocket or any changes or anything after but there's always a chance, right? So I'm going to Mark all of that but if the office comes back and needs more clarification, we'll just deal with that after. But so six, six and where is

[Speaker 2]
The primary bedroom one? Do you know?

[Speaker 4]
Us. Yeah, I don't know. I'll see if I can look up a plan. Typically Um, I'm gonna say this wall

[Speaker 2]
That one. Oh, that would make sense.

[Speaker 4]
Because bed, you know, bedside table, your bed. Usually it's going to be right here. So you would have a piece of furniture, you know, if you're thinking just a TVs, right? Um, with it up top. So, but let me look at the plan and I'll see where do you want it?

[Speaker 2]
I think that's probably okay, especially if it's an elevated one. Similar to similar to the fireplace, it'll be approximately five feet off the floor. Okay, that one's fine, pretty confidence

[Speaker 4]
Here but I'll look at the plan and confirm it.

[Speaker 6]
Okay, everyone is close to the closet as possible centered on this wall. Approximately

[Speaker 4]
And then the same locations on the main floor.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah yeah I think the locations on the main floor.

[Speaker 4]
Flex room.

[Speaker 2]
Oh sorry flex room. I

[Speaker 4]
Don't know. If it

[Speaker 2]
Can be right underneath the window, if that's a possibility, that'd be amazing.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, I'll look into it. I'll look at the plan and see. Okay. Um, okay, so that's that's that. Yeah, you're still contemplating in your brain right now the the tile and the walk-in. Okay,

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. It's It's a weird nice to have. I I cannot figure. Laundry is the only thing I've ever spent money on for upgrading. It's because like the flow is just very annoying. Um,

[Speaker 4]
And I always think, you know, obviously Aesthetics. If the walk-in closet door was here, I'd be like, oh, don't do it. Yeah, just

[Speaker 2]
Again,

[Speaker 4]
I don't not that. You want to think about resale? You're buying a new home, but you wanna. But because it's here, I don't think it would be weird, but I also don't think it's weird that it's carpet. It's just a preference, right? Um,

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. I think. Actually seven 720. Let's do it because otherwise, I'm gonna end up putting hardwood in at some point in my life. Okay. So we're

[Speaker 4]
Gonna do tile in the walk-in closet, okay? Now, the other things that I aside, from all of this specific stuff that you want, um, So the appliances, it's an electric stove.

[Speaker 2]
That's the standard

[Speaker 4]
That you see right there. And in this show home if you're happy with that one or any other electric stove, should you try to choose to upgrade? That's fine, but there's no gas line. So is gas, something you care about.

[Speaker 2]
Is there a gas line on the deck?

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, that's the next thing I was going to get to the only gas line to the house is to the furnace,

[Speaker 2]
Okay? Uh, I don't care about the stove at all. So, you're

[Speaker 4]
Okay to leave an electric.

[Speaker 2]
Yep. Okay. And

[Speaker 4]
What about to the back of the home. Um,

[Speaker 2]
Leg to the deck. Yeah.

[Speaker 4]
Sorry for your future for barbecue.

[Speaker 2]
How much is it to install one? I think

[Speaker 4]
It is. Don't quote me? It's 300 ish.

[Speaker 2]
300 ish.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, I think it's 250. I'll have it in the contract, but it's, yeah, it's not very much.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, let's get one

[Speaker 4]
And again, within reason based on the plumber, I, you know, you can do here or you could put it somewhere here.

[Speaker 2]
Think.

[Speaker 2]
Obviously you guys put aluminum railings on these. Yes, okay. And then, Do you have a copy of the Um, Uh, Of a plot map. The

[Speaker 4]
Plot plan.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I

[Speaker 4]
Can email you. I would love to email you blueprints. No,

[Speaker 2]
Sorry not not this. The um, like where the house is on the lot.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. That is the pop line. Yeah. Okay. I can send that

[Speaker 4]
To you. Okay, loud. I'm just not allowed to give up blueprints, only copyright issues. It's not that they're hiding anything. So, but yes, I will absolutely send that to you today. Yeah,

[Speaker 2]
Because it's just, I

[Speaker 4]
Don't mind. I know that

[Speaker 2]
It's like visually. It looks very tight in the in the space between the two houses. Well, there's

[Speaker 4]
Feet.

[Speaker 2]
Yep.

[Speaker 4]
So um but I'll look at the plot plan and then I'll know and then I'll send it to you but four

[Speaker 2]
Feet with one of those chunky fences. And yeah, it's not. Um, Can we put that as a TBD or like, leave this here, for the gas line and then maybe put a TBD in

[Speaker 4]
When

[Speaker 2]
When are you? We

[Speaker 4]
Because framing is, I don't know. If you drove past, it's going more quickly than I, you know, since we first started talking, I think we should add it right away here. Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
The

[Speaker 4]
Only thing, I mean you have more wall here.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, intuitively that's where I want. It is on the on the east side. This

[Speaker 4]
Might be a little tight. Yeah, but

[Speaker 2]
If you

[Speaker 4]
Upgraded your barbecue and, oh, this amazing Weber now it doesn't fit. I would say this would be safer but I wouldn't want it, right? Maybe by the door. So maybe no,

[Speaker 2]
It has to be a few. Yeah, I would say, you know, because,

[Speaker 4]
Or if

[Speaker 2]
We just had it like, even towards the end of the deck, like, as close to the end of the deck as they're allowed.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, here ish.

[Speaker 2]
Yep. Okay.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, because you're

[Speaker 2]
Not all turning it on within like a foot of the deck. Anyway,

[Speaker 4]
Nicely. Of course, this

[Speaker 2]
Is for our

[Speaker 4]
Conversation, okay? So we'll put it sort of Roughly there. Yep. So not centered but not close to the door a little bit further back right at the end. Okay?

[Speaker 2]
That works for me. So gas light,

[Speaker 4]
No, gas line for the stove.

[Speaker 2]
No gas line for the stove.

[Speaker 4]
Uh, water line to the fridge. Um it's a couple hundred bucks. The reason that they don't include it, I wish they did but not everyone upgrades their fridge. Yeah. Standard fridge does not have water and ice but we rough in the water line but it's to about I think it's 290 for them to provide the white PVC. Hook it up to the fridge, that's all because Trail appliances, who does our appliances does not do that. So, Douglas has to do that, it just depends on scope of work right now. You can wait until you go to Trail and pick your blindses and then pay the 200 bucks up

[Speaker 2]
Two. No, it's fine. I know. It's a yes for sure. That's

[Speaker 4]
A

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. Okay. So

[Speaker 4]
Well, so I'll add that in. I know, it's just one of those things but I've had a lot of people if we when we included it. That people do not breed their fridge, then we're crediting it back and it just gets confusing. So I don't know. I think that's their reasoning. So we'll do waterline to the fridge. Wait, sorry.

[Speaker 2]
290, I have to look

[Speaker 4]
It up. I really want me, but it's roughly that

[Speaker 2]
I mean the the home install is like when it's 110 from Home Depot but they totally effed up my floors when they did.

[Speaker 4]
Well, that's the only thing. Yeah, if they install your fridge, whether it's the standard or a different one from Trail. Yeah if I

[Speaker 2]
Get you guys to do it, even at an extraordinate, markup then it's you guys have the warranty. That

[Speaker 4]
Was 50 more honestly for 200 bucks. If it was me. I just wanted that.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, that's fair. No, I think that's exactly what I'm thinking and I'm gonna get a different fridge. Like, yeah, if it

[Speaker 4]
Was me, I think the standard appliances are all fine. Except for the It's just basic basic, right?

[Speaker 2]
So, okay, H2O

[Speaker 4]
Gas line to barbecue,

[Speaker 2]
We

[Speaker 4]
Know the cap, six locations again. As soon as I get more info on it, I will. But I'm at the women, the electrician letting my office know, Um, that we know where we want to do it. There'll be a clause in your contract as well stating that you have the ability to visit Trail appliances. Once it's a firm sale, make an appointment with Dennis. Dennis, the Menace. I say that. Remember at Crowfoot, the crowfoot location. I'm sure that'll

[Speaker 2]
Be in an email somewhere as well, right. Um,

[Speaker 4]
It's in the contract. Yeah, if you have any questions, obviously, ask me. Uh, as far as colors, um, they typically want them to be selected on a home before framing is fully complete. Just from a timing perspective, so don't stress today, but we should try to do it with What I say to people? Why would we do it now? Let's wait until you have your mortgage approved. You're ready to waive your conditions. You're 100 sure on the home and then we'll we'll do your selections. Did you have the opportunity to look at the color packages? I sent you.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I'm pretty comfortable with like the floor selection. Um, and the handles are, you know, Who cares?

[Speaker 4]
Well, some people like, oh, I love black some people, you know, oh I want the brush stainless, it's up to you but

[Speaker 2]
Handles are like 12 bucks.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, it's fine.

[Speaker 2]
Let's take the

[Speaker 4]
Next, you know, 10 business days to decide if you have questions about them, let me know. And then by the time, you're ready to go, then we'll send those selections. And at that point,

[Speaker 2]
What is the lighting package, the South bow has because I think they have the You have the weird hash sign right here.

[Speaker 4]
The what? Sorry, the

[Speaker 2]
Hash line is like two, two verticals. Yeah. Yeah

[Speaker 4]
I think they have like

[Speaker 2]
A weird glass sphere and stuff. Do you like

[Speaker 4]
The one? I did? Kind

[Speaker 2]
Of like it so I

[Speaker 4]
Can call them. I'm just not sure. Although I can probably look on the website and no.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, but I'll ask

[Speaker 4]
Them because that's the

[Speaker 2]
One you'd

[Speaker 4]
Prefer.

[Speaker 2]
Wouldn't mind looking like if you can send me the name of it and that way I can look at the package and see what else it comes with it. Okay

[Speaker 4]
I'll find out what it is and which package it is and then I can resend just that package.

[Speaker 2]
So you take

[Speaker 4]
A look at it. That's pretty much it. So what we do, obviously, you buy the home, we do the selections, I told you the process and timing for that electrical and plumbing options. We talked about that, uh, in your case, you want to do some extra electrical stuff. We talked about that. Um, That's it. That's all we need to really do, and include in the contract. Cool. So once, what

[Speaker 2]
About I know, you're not a huge fan of walkthrough whatever. Well, it's not

[Speaker 4]
That. I'm not a fan of it. Douglas doesn't do it. It has nothing to do with me. Oh, right. Um, I'm the salesperson. I don't do construction, walkthroughs. I have to go with the processes for each company. I work with and their processes with the volume of homes. They sell they offer. I think I told you those two walkthroughs, but I do understand what you're saying. I work for Builders where I actually did a frame walkthrough with the site super to introduce the cl. Super, but again, every Builder is different. So but I did talk to Paul

[Speaker 4]
And said, hey, like when the time comes, can, you know, can we try to figure this out? So I will do my absolute best. And if for some reason he cannot and I can, I will drive out there and we'll let you walk through. I can't make any changes. I'm not, you know, I'm not an electrician or a framer or no, for me,

[Speaker 2]
It's more. Like you

[Speaker 4]
Can see where the studs are. You can see like I'm happy to do that. I just want to know

[Speaker 2]
Where not to drill and where to be careful to drill and stuff. So it's like, Like post plumbing post high voltage. Electrical post electrical

[Speaker 4]
Just

[Speaker 2]
Being able to right before they slap the drywall on, do a walk through, you know, take some snapshots of the critical areas gas line. So what I'm

[Speaker 4]
Going to do because so it doesn't get missed in my own mind because that's again, not something I typically do, I'm going to put a note, I'm going to ask Paul to let me know as soon as he has scheduled insulation. So I know when that is so that I can say, hey, can you meet Colton in the home and do it just a quick 10-15 minute? Whatever. He does a few communities then a day that I'm not physically here, and my assistant is I'll say, hey Cole, can I meet you out there at noon or one or whatever?

[Speaker 4]
Do a quick walkthrough.

[Speaker 2]
Yep. Does that

[Speaker 4]
Work? That works

[Speaker 2]
For me? Yeah, okay, so

[Speaker 4]
I'll make notes of that so I don't, you know, forget I would forget but yeah, who knows, right? I go it's insulated, it's like, oh no. So we just want to make sure we get in there once electric and Plumbing, but I go up every week to upgrade update everybody, so I'll know when, um, the heating has begun and when Plumbing has become I'll know when that stuff

[Speaker 2]
Is, So based on where it is with framing, You know, heating ductwork whatever. Plumbing. What is the kind of proposed timeline?

[Speaker 4]
They don't tell me anything. So,

[Speaker 2]
My concern is like with like so with my conditions for two of the lenders, Is that they would like me to have my condo sold before I like before the actual possession date for this property. Oh,

[Speaker 4]
Of course. So yeah. Okay, more than you need today.

[Speaker 2]
Sure. So, you will get two

[Speaker 4]
Months, notice, that'll also be outlined in the purchase.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, two months, notice

[Speaker 4]
For possession. But, Drywall is underway

[Speaker 2]
And

[Speaker 4]
All the mudding and taping is done. The ceiling texturing is done that is when in this case Paul Concept possession. Okay? So but he'll know when that texture date is. That's always the key thing, textured, it. So then he'll know. So I'll probably know closer to three months in advance, okay? And

[Speaker 2]
Again, it won't

[Speaker 4]
Be an exact day. It'll be a tentative but at least we'll have a good idea but as we go through, like I said, I try to go up every week unless something crazy happens. I'll know. So it's almost I've been out through this week, but once framing is done, then windows and doors have to go in. Then HVAC is typically first. Um, so the heating is done and then after that, it comes Plumbing, and then electrical, and then we have to get the city of Airdrie out, to do an inspection. So sometimes it can sit for it, can even be two or three weeks depending on the inspector's availability.

[Speaker 4]
Once the inspection is done, then that's their trigger to. They can't insulate drywall, but during that time, ideally, that's when the ciders would be doing the siding.

[Speaker 2]
So obviously we

[Speaker 4]
Don't insulate a drywall, when there's no siding for obvious reasons. So, so that's sort of the order of operations. So, being out there every week and I'm sure you'll probably drive past, we'll know where we're at. So I'm not too worried about missing our window of opportunity to walk through. But as far as

[Speaker 2]
Society is like a three-month kind of

[Speaker 4]
Basically, once the ruffins are sort of underway, that's because it's different trades, right? And it's, it's all availability else. Like

[Speaker 2]
When I

[Speaker 4]
Talk to Paulie's like, oh, the signers are over this community, I get them over here and we lost a crew, we hired a crew, so it really he juggles a lot of that stuff. Um, but based on where we are now, if everything goes in a perfect world smoothly, uh, we don't have minus 30 by the time we have to side, that's the only part of construction that is affected by cold weather is citing. They can pour concrete, they can do everything else. Framing is done in two weeks. Maybe

[Speaker 5]
Three

[Speaker 4]
Weeks from now windows and doors are in or going in something like that. Again, this is just Tentative, that's right. So that takes us to the end of November. We do lose a couple weeks, unfortunately ish in December because of the holidays. So I would say we're going to be into well into Ruffins in January, okay? Let's say sighting happens. Again weather permitting sometimes January February. That's what I'd like to see, right March. So I've just been telling people prior to you as well. Interested in this home, we were looking at a tentative summer, right? If it's sooner, awesome, but that's kind of what we're looking at.

[Speaker 4]
I'll talk to Paul about because he he has obviously boots on the ground, a little more knowledge of that and we'll see if I can narrow that down a little bit. Yeah, for me

[Speaker 2]
It's like

[Speaker 2]
I'm sitting it's like just below that 20% mark. So, Or without selling. Um, For me, I'm always happier or I will be happier if it's like, you know, May June July rather than you know, if it's if it's March and February, it just puts a little bit more pressure on me to sell, take a

[Speaker 3]
Little

[Speaker 4]
Bit, a little bit of a loss. So 100 certainty. It will not be March of February. Okay, because I, the homes. I have that I am sort of anticipating March or February are Way Beyond.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. Uh,

[Speaker 4]
Watch. I see that and they go like crazy fast, but no, um, I don't see that happening, okay? So

[Speaker 2]
It'll be like, it will be like a May almost, for sure. I would

[Speaker 4]
Say.

[Speaker 2]
Will be a me.

[Speaker 4]
I would say. That's the absolute earliest,

[Speaker 2]
Absolute earliest. Okay, that makes me feel happy.

[Speaker 4]
May if

[Speaker 2]
You can if you can write down in like your little notes like July 15th and just nudge it towards that day,

[Speaker 4]
I'll do my best. July would be the preferable. Again, it's going to be what it's going to be, but let me talk to Paul because it actually the framing has gone very quickly now that the crews are up there so that's nice to see. So um

[Speaker 2]
And then this is kind of a I don't know, I don't think you can write this into a contract or do anything other than like, A handshake agreement but like Garage gets built. Presumably pretty quickly. There's no insulation. There's is there any siding or anything? Oh, yeah. 12. Okay, so and then when is that like towards the end or is where is that?

[Speaker 4]
Well in an Ideal World? And in a lot of homes, the garage will be done at the same time as the home. There are situations where it's not 100 done. You move in it's not completely done. Besiding is still going on or there's still so that could happen.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. Um,

[Speaker 4]
It's going to be cited to match your home of course. And I I know I said that to you quickly last night I just got home from being out of town and I didn't no worries around. I was hoping maybe you would have the wherewithal to Google it, but I'm happy to do that for you. Put the name color names and it shows up.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, I'm happy

[Speaker 4]
To send you that link but um, yeah, it'll be cited. Electric garage door, obviously garage door opener with remote, it'll be energized. Uh, it doesn't have its own pan, a little half. I have to look at it the code probably three outlets something like that.

[Speaker 2]
Okay,

[Speaker 4]
Whatever the code is for

[Speaker 2]
Underground. There's no like a weird freaking hanging wire going from the house to the all underground. Okay perfect.

[Speaker 4]
Um,

[Speaker 2]
You might not know. This is the like. So, is there a button beside the door? That's like, just two little tiny wires. Is that kind of how it runs? Are you talking

[Speaker 4]
About the garage door? Yes,

[Speaker 2]
So

[Speaker 4]
It'll have a keypad.

[Speaker 2]
Yep, and it'll

[Speaker 4]
Have a crusher opener.

[Speaker 2]
Oh my God. Someone

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, old school.

[Speaker 2]
Gotcha. So there's no like, inside the the garage, there's not like just a random punch button.

[Speaker 4]
No. Kind of aware of yeah.

[Speaker 2]
No. That's like, uh, it's a weird nice to have for Historic reasons. But nothing that I actually, Care too deeply about, um, Yeah, I was gonna say if, like the garage could, if the garage is done earlier, it would be nice to be able to like, You know, if there's like a two-week window before possession day where I could, like

[Speaker 4]
I get it, that's right. Yeah. Unfortunately, they do not let people store stuff, it's just a lot of it. I know, I mean, I want them to be helpful and I get, I don't make those rules, but I think maybe in the historically when they've maybe done that, not just Douglas, but I think Builder there's been issues, right? Something was stolen something got vandalized, whatever? So, unfortunately, no, we can't do that. Sorry.

[Speaker 2]
Um, Cool. So okay, so you're gonna send me the contract. Everything

[Speaker 4]
Will be nice and shiny time to draft it. But again, I'm going to put in the tile. I'm going to put in all the additional. So these things will increase the the purchase price obviously slightly. I'll put in that water line to fridge. A claw saying you you know can obviously go in selection slash upgrade your your kitchen appliances washer dryers not included. I think you know that I wanted to make sure you did. Okay. Um you can get them a trail if you get a good deal or anywhere you want. It doesn't matter.

[Speaker 2]
Said Trail does do stairs.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, just shop. I would shop around too. I mean Trail. I'd like to think because they are our supplier. You get a good deal, but if you find a better deal somewhere else, I mean, absolutely.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. Um,

[Speaker 4]
I think that's all I need in the contract. I mean, I just don't want to miss anything because I hate having people have to do stuff after. Not me, I don't mind doing that. I mean you, but I think we've covered everything.

[Speaker 2]
I'm mostly okay with it. It's, I mean, Yeah. I think. I think that covers most money, thoughts and questions and concerns.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, let me

[Speaker 2]
Let me double check my list.

[Speaker 2]
Weird list of questions. I didn't even update this yet. Um,

[Speaker 2]
Let me see if

[Speaker 6]
I miss or something.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, the basement

[Speaker 4]
Mechanical. I mean it cannot be changed, but you.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I mean

[Speaker 4]
To me, it makes sense. Where else are they going to put it? Um, Douglas does. I'm not just saying that because I work here currently, but they do do a good job. Uh, in every house I've seen of ensuring that it's tucked away to allow for the best possible basement development, in the future. Sometimes I've seen Builders where they're sort of plunked in the middle and didn't seem to make sense.

[Speaker 6]
I've not seen that with with Douglas Horns, I don't know. I was in a year and a half old one from

[Speaker 2]
In Waterford and it was It wasn't plunked in the middle, but I was like a weird triangle shape that was like,

[Speaker 4]
Okay,

[Speaker 2]
Not accessible. But

[Speaker 4]
This to me looks good.

[Speaker 2]
This now this one's fine, it looks like it's the same layout as uh as South bow and like it's like

[Speaker 4]
South Pole is pretty sensible. Basically right on either side of the uh

[Speaker 2]
I think it's just here, right? I think we had here. Did I miss that in? The the South Pole one had it all together and it was very nice because of that electrical meter.

[Speaker 4]
Sorry. That's I meant like so rough and coming for your future bathroom. Oh, yeah, yeah, one side of the stairs, and the Mechanicals.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[Speaker 4]
I think I mean to me when I look at it, that makes the most sense personally, but it is what it is. Um,

[Speaker 2]
Mechanicals here, right? Yeah.

[Speaker 4]
But yeah, on either side of the stairs, I think that makes no sense.

[Speaker 2]
I noticed you updated the PDF. It's much nicer now.

[Speaker 4]
Which one? I'm sorry.

[Speaker 2]
Uh, this one.

[Speaker 4]
Now, I just printed that off.

[Speaker 2]
It it aligns with the compass rows now. Oh

[Speaker 4]
There we go, that's better. Yeah, that

[Speaker 2]
Was driving me nuts for

[Speaker 4]
Fair enough.

[Speaker 2]
I was trying so hard to read it and every time I was getting frustrated. Yeah, no I

[Speaker 4]
Get it. I get it. Um, Okay. I was a few questions I got sidetracked. Yeah, mechanicals. So Landscaping again, nothing final grading, you know what that is.

[Speaker 2]
Um,

[Speaker 4]
So they just basically level the site from back side. We should be cleaning of debris. They fight they level it for water. Drainage that in order to then have the city come out, so they can get their final grade slip,

[Speaker 6]
And then you can

[Speaker 4]
Do your Landscaping, so it may not be, and again, I don't know. Let's say your possession for sake of conversation is sort of June July August in there somewhere. You may not get to your Landscaping until the following season. Because reading has to be done. It just depends on weather and stuff. Okay, just so, you know.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I think

[Speaker 4]
To our most, yes, that is that is this elevation Uh, what else was it? Make sure your color is, okay, the garage. 20 by 20 is the size of your garage.

[Speaker 2]
Read the garage is bigger than the house.

[Speaker 4]
Uh,

[Speaker 6]
Can you ask Paul and or

[Speaker 2]
The powers that be? And this doesn't have to be like I'm just curious how they came across the the 194.

[Speaker 4]
The what? Sorry. The 19-4

[Speaker 2]
All the other ferny threes are 20 feet wide.

[Speaker 4]
I have no idea and I

[Speaker 2]
Would love the the story even if it's just like as A rumor from someone. It

[Speaker 4]
Could be a typo for all. I know. Let me look at the blueprint. And the plot plan.

[Speaker 6]
Okay, I'm going

[Speaker 4]
To send you the plot plan.

[Speaker 2]
Yes,

[Speaker 4]
I sent you the basement. When you saw the basement blueprint, of course. Again, I wish I could send it all to you, but I'll take a look at it. I mean, I know I've never seen this. It's either 18, 19, or 20 in every home marketing, uh, material that's provided to me. So, yeah, let me look into that for you. Of course.

[Speaker 2]
Unfortunately, I'm quite confident that it's, it's accurate. Because I also lose the linen closet here. Let me hide that one, because it's

[Speaker 4]
This,

[Speaker 2]
This is not a linen closet, that's where in the other. For any threes, it is because it's a foot deeper.

[Speaker 5]
But

[Speaker 2]
I've tried, I I'm very curious as to how it came to be this one. Sorry,

[Speaker 4]
This is from Waterford. No, this

[Speaker 2]
Is, this is the one that I got you to initial, oh,

[Speaker 4]
Right? Yeah, yeah. But it's

[Speaker 2]
The, it's the not, it's the old one, right? Um, That's where that's the, the newer one for the same build, same, same lot.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah,

[Speaker 2]
It just flips the flips, the windows to match up, which was driving me Bonkers.

[Speaker 4]
Um,

[Speaker 2]
But now the Waterford one is a little bit wider and it's a little bit more squat, okay? Um, but But I'll just confirm this. Yeah, yeah. Well, I It's less that. Like, I'm I'm pretty sure it is 194. I'm just curious if there's like Historic reasons, if Paul maybe has like a oh we had to avoid something. Maybe there's like a, a, um,

[Speaker 7]
Corridor on the, which every corner lot has.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah.

[Speaker 4]
Um, and that's,

[Speaker 2]
You know,

[Speaker 4]
Why they had to set it not back but over. Yeah, slightly. So that would, if,

[Speaker 2]
If that's why like I, I would love to just know that reason. So that, you know, five years later, I'm like, oh oh yeah. That there's this weird thing. No, no.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah. I'll find out.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. Yeah.

[Speaker 4]
Why?

[Speaker 2]
Yes, it does. Like, yeah,

[Speaker 4]
I'm

[Speaker 2]
Not expecting you guys to fix anything or change anything, because I called it,

[Speaker 4]
But it's good to know why. Yeah,

[Speaker 2]
Right and,

[Speaker 4]
And I want to know why now. So, of course, I should know why. Um, When it's all spec homes like this because I don't do myself personally with Douglas and Douglas doesn't do pre-sales pre-sale homes, where someone comes in and says, I like the ferny three. Yeah, what lots? Do you have right? And I'm gonna go, we have this one, this one's a walkout, this is North exposure and then I do a lot more of that and I would know the answer to this because I have to get it plotted on the lot, make sure it fits but the way that Douglas Holmes is, structured everything is a speck home. So

[Speaker 5]
All

[Speaker 4]
That plotting and all of those details. Uh, not that any of the sales people here, don't have knowledge of that, we don't deal with it.

[Speaker 4]
Answer to this but I will find out. Okay and what's

[Speaker 2]
This lab? Oh that was actually. I keep not. Remembering to ask this, what is this?

[Speaker 4]
Which, what are we looking at

[Speaker 2]
Concrete pad

[Speaker 4]
Front concrete pad. So they're probably talking about Oh, I don't know rear garage. They're probably talking about maybe your sidewalk

[Speaker 4]
I'll have to look at a blueprint. Let's do front concrete pad.

[Speaker 2]
I've been told it might be like that. There's a poured concrete area here.

[Speaker 4]
There's with all of our town homes. That's why I'm just thinking, uh, with our townhomes. We do have a little concrete, they call it a patio, it's not huge. But with yeah, I'll have to look at the floor plan.

[Speaker 2]
Okay,

[Speaker 4]
Add the blueprint. I mean, okay. And when

[Speaker 2]
I was looking at the architectural suggestions, it says that there should be a full height chimney on Corners or detailing. Is there, is there a chimney on this?

[Speaker 4]
It'll just be for Aesthetics, of course. Yeah.

[Speaker 6]
You know what? Since

[Speaker 4]
You're here, I can show you the blueprints. I just can't print them or email them. Let me pull them up

[Speaker 6]
Because obviously this is just so funny.

[Speaker 5]
Okay,

[Speaker 6]
Give me two seconds here. I'm just

[Speaker 2]
I don't know. I think it was something that I was like, huh? That's a that's a weird requirement. But apparently all Corners are supposed to have chimneys

[Speaker 4]
But also it's

[Speaker 2]
Like

[Speaker 4]
It again

[Speaker 2]
This this entire bill doesn't seem to follow the the corner, lot requirements, very strictly so. Well they I

[Speaker 4]
Mean they have to if they're building it on the corner. But I'd be maybe melkor has some leniency with certain things. I don't know, right? Because I don't deal with the end of the business but

[Speaker 6]
Um

[Speaker 6]
I hate

[Speaker 4]
PCS Colton.

[Speaker 2]
Me too.

[Speaker 4]
Oh do you usually people that are an ITA Apple?

[Speaker 2]
Oh I hate them both.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, well, fair enough. Sorry, I have to restart it. Give me a second, I apologize. But since you're here, I would, I'd be happy to show you the blueprints. That would make me feel good for you. Yeah. Um, because I, I do wish I was able to provide them.

[Speaker 6]
It just has

[Speaker 4]
To reboot. So I'll show you those in a minute. Um, Okay, I'll look up the side, elevations, we'll take a boo at the plot plan, as well, which I will email to you. Okay, okay.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, why really?

[Speaker 4]
Updates. See, at least Apple you don't doesn't do this.

[Speaker 6]
Wow, I

[Speaker 4]
Don't care the updates, required. I mean, you, you do the update if you so choose to do it, but it doesn't like we can't open right now unless we do all these updates. Yeah. You

[Speaker 2]
Know.

[Speaker 4]
It is what it is. So do you work from home solely or are you?

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. Well, such from last month but that was special. My my office is in Estonia.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, I get it, that's it. Yeah. Okay. So that's just their head office.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, technically the head office is Chicago, I.T engineering Hub is a little town called tartu.

[Speaker 4]
Estonia of all places I mean I know roughly where it is on the European map but that's yeah.

[Speaker 2]
They at one point had the best internet in the world, um, because they invested heavily into it Estonia.

[Speaker 4]
You can go

[Speaker 2]
On hikes and have like 5G internet. Like the entire, I mean, the whole country is smaller than the south of all like is smaller than the area. South of Red Deer.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah. Um,

[Speaker 2]
Not crazy that they have great LTE and 5G everywhere. But It's just, it's weird. Yeah, I

[Speaker 4]
Remember when I was learning all of the, you know, on a map, all the European countries though. Um, I used since I just came to me, I used to call it a stone's throw because I was trying to remember where Estonia was in relation to Does it border Russia?

[Speaker 2]
Russia

[Speaker 4]
Latvia Latvia. That's right. It was a stone's throw. Isn't that funny I remember from childhood. Oh yeah. Stoney is a stone's throw. Starting to finish the things you remember. Yeah.

[Speaker 6]
Sorry, we're 30, my apologies, no worries.

[Speaker 2]
A friend of mine took me to, uh, to hike along with the Russian border, which was interesting. Oh,

[Speaker 4]
Wow. That would be an experience.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I was asking him. Apparently, I know, like the most trivial of their military Secrets, just from having conversations with people who work there. Yeah.

[Speaker 4]
And I was

[Speaker 2]
Like, oh, so where are these like bunker things that people aren't supposed to know about, but it's kind of an Open Secret. He's like, shut the fuck up.

[Speaker 4]
That's hilarious. Yeah. Bones are listening? Yeah.

[Speaker 6]
So

[Speaker 4]
It was you that was interfering in the U.S election. I knew it.

[Speaker 6]
No, I'm kidding.

[Speaker 6]
Although I'm really happy though because crypto's

[Speaker 4]
Gone way up now. I know it sounds so selfish to be happy that someone like Trump got reelected for that reason but it's true.

[Speaker 6]
I have like

[Speaker 2]
Two dollars in Dogecoin and it's worth like 20. And it's like why

[Speaker 4]
This is stupid. Hey my Doge I I think I've made a couple Grand in the last 48 Hours on Dogecoin to be honest.

[Speaker 2]
I, at some point Dogecoin was being given out for every Reddit up vote.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, really

[Speaker 2]
Like in 2016 and so somewhere, I have a wallet with thousands of them. Oh

[Speaker 6]
That's the worst.

[Speaker 4]
I don't have much of it. I just have Bitcoin and some uh, muscle on. I mean, I have a bunch of them. Who am? I kidding? I have a lot of Shiba Inu and stuff too. But I

[Speaker 6]
Some

[Speaker 2]
Of the people you expect to be the crypto nerds anymore.

[Speaker 6]
It's true.

[Speaker 2]
My, uh, By one neighbor. Lovely woman had to ask me over to show her how to do something like simple and Chrome. Oh is how to get from like Trello which is like a, just like a task management to Google Drive,

[Speaker 4]
Okay? I

[Speaker 2]
Was like click. Oh you just have to click in and then click a different link. Yeah and

[Speaker 4]
Like

[Speaker 2]
She's got hundreds of thousands of dollars.

[Speaker 4]
I remember being so proud of myself. Maybe three years ago when I wanted to buy like D5, like I was on uh I wanted to buy something for my I don't know some old coin that you could only buy like, oh my trust wallet, right? Like I had to go and I

[Speaker 5]
Know

[Speaker 4]
I did, how do I do this? So I I was so proud that I figured it's easy to go. I'm like well simpler by Bitcoin but I was trying to buy. I think it was an arbitrary. I can't remember what it was. Anyways, I was buying something and uh oh you know what? It was probably. Um, Um, what do you call it? Why can't I think of it? It doesn't matter but now it'll bug me because I don't remember. It was probably I missed the boat on Pepe. I was late to Pepe but I I've made a little bit but not my like me a few hundred bucks. Anyways that was what I'm trying to figure out. How do I buy pet bank? Where do I go? Hold up. Anyway it's okay I could talk later forever. Okay.

[Speaker 4]
What is the job number again?

[Speaker 6]
Oh, what

[Speaker 4]
Was that from last night? Perfect. Okay.

[Speaker 4]
Okay. So these are the plans. So that's the front. And then we can get a weird Gable which is kind of cool. Yeah,

[Speaker 6]
I think it's the farm.

[Speaker 2]
I really like the weird Slants. Like the I don't know the the modern in uh in Waterford

[Speaker 4]
The flatter. Is it more of a flat style? It just goes

[Speaker 2]
Up one way and not the other like it doesn't meet. Yeah.

[Speaker 4]
Exactly. What you mean.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, those ones are cool. Um so this

[Speaker 4]
Will show your deck of course your railing your side entrance. Okay. So it

[Speaker 2]
Does come with stairs so

[Speaker 4]
This is the side where everything is right jackass.

[Speaker 6]
Okay.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, smart boards. Oh, it has smart board Corners.

[Speaker 4]
Your stone. Column there, yeah. This is the other side. So it shows your window wells. You know, you have those two side windows there, this is the street side, of course, right? So this is the extra detailing that was required by melcor. Is

[Speaker 2]
That true with those? Oh, there is only oh. So this

[Speaker 4]
Is the sorry, the basement. Oh

[Speaker 2]
Sorry. No, I was looking at the top. I was like so this is the

[Speaker 4]
Street side. Yeah. So when we

[Speaker 2]
Talk about

[Speaker 4]
Extra detailing requirements are from melkor, in this case would be this My experience and love with the window grills.

[Speaker 2]
I see that's it.

[Speaker 6]
Okay. All right. What

[Speaker 2]
Are the window grills made out of, as a little MDF like tackons?

[Speaker 4]
Uh, no, it'll be metal like in the window itself, okay? Like

[Speaker 2]
The

[Speaker 4]
Window itself,

[Speaker 2]
Just like aluminum pipe, or something exactly, just

[Speaker 4]
Because it's visible. So it looks a little bit, you know?

[Speaker 2]
Gotcha. We have

[Speaker 4]
Some, of course, uh, vertical, siding detailing here. Remember I mentioned those two colors, so we have a little bit more, so,

[Speaker 2]
That's the accent color.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah,

[Speaker 4]
Exactly. Yeah, room for me. Your rear detailing again, a little bit more architectural stuff here, required? Because this will be visible from the street as well. These Gables here, which wouldn't normally be there. See the windows without the The grills, right? That's

[Speaker 2]
The difference. It does show

[Speaker 4]
On here too sliders. These are all sliders

[Speaker 2]
Oh, you can open the south facing window. Yeah. Interesting we'll show which ones are sliders which ones are picked up, right?

[Speaker 4]
So

[Speaker 2]
On the, on the Yeah, this one that one does outside as well.

[Speaker 4]
Please do not these do.

[Speaker 2]
Really, okay? And those are they're still like the the like triple pain or double paint like full full inch thick chunky ones,

[Speaker 4]
They'll be double pane. Um, You know, argon gas slowing, you know Windows? Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Exactly like okay

[Speaker 4]
Triple pain is not very common unless it's a little bit more custom stuff but Same thing. This window opens, there's another basement window right at the rear, these are the two minerals. So here's our basement that I oops, that I had sent you. Just snip it off.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, I kind of looked at

[Speaker 2]
It before, what is? Okay so there's per precast concrete veranda steps.

[Speaker 6]
Yes.

[Speaker 2]
Interesting sidewalk sits on. Okay. So I get like a little one and a half foot of extra space at the landing for a potted plant or something. Yeah, exactly something

[Speaker 4]
Decorative, cool. Main floor. So it is carpet standard in the flex room.

[Speaker 2]
Yep, this is all

[Speaker 4]
Hardwood everywhere else.

[Speaker 6]
Okay.

[Speaker 4]
Carpet on the stairs.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, the flex room has carpet. It does.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
How much to change that to hardwood? I'd have to

[Speaker 4]
Get the office to give me a price for it. I'm gonna Know, I'd say a couple Grandish.

[Speaker 2]
I mean, I Can you get me the exact model of hardwood? Um,

[Speaker 4]
Absolutely. Can we when we make that decision on the interior colors. Oh, it's

[Speaker 2]
On the right here. Yeah, yeah, sorry. Yeah. Right? Because that's interesting. Okay.

[Speaker 4]
Is that something you want me to find out and do? I

[Speaker 2]
Would love for you to to find out the price for that because you might want to

[Speaker 4]
Add to the purchase contract.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, because as much

[Speaker 4]
As we want to draft it and sign it today. If it's another day or two to get you, I don't want you to rush. But is

[Speaker 2]
There, is there anyone else actively looking at this right now? I had a couple Realtors

[Speaker 4]
Call me. Yeah. Um,

[Speaker 2]
But I've

[Speaker 4]
Told them that it's out of respect to you that it's conditional and I'll know within the next couple of weeks, okay? Because

[Speaker 2]
I'm not going

[Speaker 4]
To take a deposit from you sell it to somebody else. Okay? Out today. Rachel my girl at the office is fantastic. I'll call her, she's just our sales coordinator, she just Fields the questions, and

[Speaker 6]
It does

[Speaker 2]
Come with the glass windows or glass doors.

[Speaker 6]
Yes.

[Speaker 2]
Okay,

[Speaker 4]
Double doors. Um, Well, clear. What does it say on here?

[Speaker 6]
French clear. Oops.

[Speaker 2]
The South bow guy. Wasn't sure if that was an upgrade or not. Yeah.

[Speaker 4]
Usually it's standard. Like these are standard on this model, but I always want to see it. I don't want to say until

[Speaker 6]
I've seen it. Okay, then upstairs.

[Speaker 2]
No one. What's sorry? What's the height of the floor in the basement,

[Speaker 4]
Not eight feet,

[Speaker 2]
Eight feet.

[Speaker 4]
It's nine on the main eight up eight down.

[Speaker 6]
Okay.

[Speaker 2]
Just, I was looking at the Airdrie requirements for finishing and making a separate unit.

[Speaker 8]
Yeah, so it just shows oh everything we know.

[Speaker 2]
Oh yeah, all the good stuff.

[Speaker 4]
This is just your shelving. So this double obviously means that it's double and this is just single and double shelving.

[Speaker 6]
Um, Yeah,

[Speaker 2]
This is the the biggest change between the other three of the the building is Because they made it the eight inches narrower where this this

[Speaker 4]
Is

[Speaker 2]
What's supposed to be at the linen closet. This was supposed to be in a second linen closet. Um, And that was, like, something I stared at for hours.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, really, okay. It's saying we're doing four hooks here though, which is kind of cool. To

[Speaker 2]
Hang well yeah but it's over carpet. So you can't even hang towels or anything?

[Speaker 4]
No, robes. I don't know. Yeah you're

[Speaker 2]
Right.

[Speaker 4]
You're right.

[Speaker 6]
Um, and are we doing

[Speaker 4]
The tech camera?

[Speaker 2]
Oh, sorry. Did we say that?

[Speaker 4]
What was your final?

[Speaker 2]
Yes. 720, right? Yeah, yes tile. Yes. We are gonna do that.

[Speaker 4]
Yep. So, yeah. So hooks, yeah. That'll

[Speaker 2]
Be fine. You're right. You're right.

[Speaker 4]
Carpet. W shows your doors. It is double doors for the closets and bedroom, two, and three your laundry.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, they're the magnetic ones, right?

[Speaker 4]
Uh yeah there I mean there were regular passage door. They're not like a cream bifold obviously, but they're just ranking up doors. Yes. But

[Speaker 2]
They have like the, the magnetic. Uh, In the top. Yeah, Douglas has those most

[Speaker 4]
Of them do but again it's just stay it on the plan.

[Speaker 2]
Gotcha, two doors,

[Speaker 4]
Let me check with Paul because I don't want to say, oh yeah, I think so, but no specified that here. So I

[Speaker 2]
Have that as a mental note, I need to check them on the walkthrough the final walkthrough because I saw that they were cracked in some of the uh,

[Speaker 4]
Oh oh.

[Speaker 2]
Um, other homes.

[Speaker 6]
Just a cross

[Speaker 4]
Section there of

[Speaker 4]
And it has the height here, right? So, we're eight two and a bit. Probably just shows the height.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, interesting. Are those part of the selection package? Are those those? Okay.

[Speaker 5]
And

[Speaker 4]
On the lighting package, each package package obviously?

[Speaker 2]
Okay, I did not. Obviously look at the

[Speaker 4]
Leggings our, um, coach lights. They're called soy.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah,

[Speaker 4]
It'll be out of place on there.

[Speaker 6]
Okay.

[Speaker 2]
Can you exercise can you go back up?

[Speaker 3]
Can

[Speaker 2]
You send me a screenshot of like just this area

[Speaker 4]
The Veranda? Yeah,

[Speaker 2]
Just so I know where the lights are going. Because I don't I don't think I would have pictured them there at all.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
I mean they have to

[Speaker 4]
Be, you know, if you're looking at You have to be somewhere. So typically there's just not enough space here. So that's why it's here. Right. That's here because there's not really enough space here. And if it was a recess, probably a different story, of course, but

[Speaker 6]
Don't stop calling me. Would you mind if I get this?

[Speaker 4]
No, I'm gonna call them back. I'm circle. Hello, this is Trish. Or not. Okay, sorry. Uh, this is just the tall wall.

[Speaker 6]
Okay, which is the tallest wobble. Oh magical Tresses.

[Speaker 2]
What's the sorry? What's this, flash detail? I don't care. I will not understand it anywhere.

[Speaker 4]
Uh, just this is this is what goes out to site for the framers and stuff, right? Oh my goodness. I'm so sorry Colton.

[Speaker 8]
Hello, this is Trish.

[Speaker 6]
No, I saw the number. I'm

[Speaker 4]
Just in the middle. I did answer the the most recent time before. Now I just I'm with a client. Can I call you right back? That's okay. Okay. All right. Thanks so much. Okay bye.

[Speaker 4]
Okay. This is you don't need to. I just thought it might be interesting to see but this isn't anything that you need. This is worth again for the guys on site. Uh vapor Berry is stuff when they do the fact

[Speaker 2]
Sorry. What's the oh I saw acoustic ceiling.

[Speaker 2]
Acoustic sealant.

[Speaker 4]
Mario. Kingston

[Speaker 2]
This one.

[Speaker 4]
Oh here.

[Speaker 2]
Cool. Acoustic ceiling. Both plates is this exterior wall, okay. Vapor barrier installation. R20, installation and sheathing. Appreciated solution, the purchase contract 2, has a lot of info,

[Speaker 4]
So there's going to be the purchase contract

[Speaker 2]
For

[Speaker 4]
Able to purchase and sell and it's about 10 pages long then. There's

[Speaker 6]
Going to be

[Speaker 4]
Two schedules. One is a schedule. A one is a schedule B

[Speaker 2]
Schedule. A

[Speaker 4]
Goes through from a construction perspective, everything it'll say, the thickness of your garage slab. Your basement concrete. Slab Etc, goes through how we frame the homes uh the insulation r value exterior versus, you know. So of course, actually through all of that,

[Speaker 2]
Not every

[Speaker 4]
Builder includes that which is awesome schedu. Top of, in addition to Douglas's standards that were in the, a schedule that's been added to this home, right? So, hardwood quartz countertops, all that kind of stuff. And at the very end of that schedule, B is going to be anything that I take been specific to you. Meaning, you know, the the um, the cap six, you know, upgrading to Tyler the walk-in closet. So I'm going to add all of those things. At the end of that schedule, then there's supporting documents. Like, I have you sign off on this once I've marked it a little more nicely, of course.

[Speaker 4]
You sign off on, you know, that you're legally able to purchase a home in Canada, a few little supporting documents like that. Okay. So there's a lot of info and the reason I brought that up is because some of this is the r value. Specifically is going to be itemized in the contract. Okay. Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
I've never seen an acoustic sealant actually written down on any piece of paper before. So it's like, what is that used for?

[Speaker 6]
Okay

[Speaker 2]
Sorry no

[Speaker 6]
No that's

[Speaker 4]
Why I'm doing this. That's what you're saying.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, this is just

[Speaker 2]
Lots of wall stuff. Yeah.

[Speaker 4]
Let's put the plot one. I mean I will send it to you but since we're sitting here, if you want to look at, it's up to you. Yeah.

[Speaker 6]
Wouldn't mind.

[Speaker 6]
All right, so

[Speaker 4]
This is So obviously the street Some French. This is your corner.

[Speaker 2]
Street corner and it is. Nine percent grade 1.2 meters. Is that what that is? Which one

[Speaker 4]
Which dimension are you? Looking to

[Speaker 2]
Write this the side to the, to the line?

[Speaker 6]
I

[Speaker 2]
Assume. That's what that is. What is 1.2 meters that four feet?

[Speaker 4]
No, I don't know. I I think in feet so

[Speaker 2]
Yeah let's just show. Four feet. Okay. Interesting. It's just the like getting an AC in there is going to be really tight.

[Speaker 4]
Because you're wanting to put it on the side. Yeah, I

[Speaker 2]
Think it has to be on the side. No. Well I mean you

[Speaker 4]
Could put it at the back

[Speaker 6]
What to say?

[Speaker 2]
Because the mechanical room is, Right here here. So this

[Speaker 6]
Would

[Speaker 4]
Be the ideal location

[Speaker 2]
Yeah.

[Speaker 4]
In this area here.

[Speaker 2]
Now, what's the head of the deck do you remember?

[Speaker 4]
Off the ground.

[Speaker 9]
Yeah, I don't even know if they've they haven't. I

[Speaker 4]
Don't know.

[Speaker 2]
Because a good theoretically go under there depending on the height of it. But I mean

[Speaker 4]
I'm going to go out there this week as I always do. So I'll get a better sense of the grading. So when we look at Yeah, so what do we hear 98.7?

[Speaker 2]
In

[Speaker 4]
The front and then by the time we get all the way to the back. We're at about 99.79. So that's the difference in grade from the front to the back. This is a huge It's a pretty level lot.

[Speaker 2]
I don't know. I just, I saw that one of the one of the restrictions or one of the The details was that any air conditioner? Had to be covered. Can't be visible from the street really

[Speaker 4]
If anyone told me that so okay. Um, That seems crazy to me because it's on the corner you're saying.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah so if I put it like you would have to be either under the deck or or Like three feet is pretty narrow there.

[Speaker 2]
And then you have absolutely no way to walk to the backyard on the on the right side if you put something there, obviously.

[Speaker 4]
Now, would you though? I mean, again just a question like if you're going to do your most people would have probably your gate here. Right? Come this way. Do a day here. You probably wouldn't do a second gate here.

[Speaker 2]
I mean if it's tight, I would probably do like a fence right there if depending on what the neighbors are comfortable,

[Speaker 4]
Maybe the window I would do it here. Just yeah exactly. Yeah

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, that's why

[Speaker 6]
Or sorry

[Speaker 4]
Like this

[Speaker 2]
Oh, no, because that's the, that's the door. So then, oh sorry. What

[Speaker 4]
Am I looking at? Oh, the side door, sorry, yeah,

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. So how did Roy behind the side door? So, whoever, you know, if I rent out, the basement is a separate Suite. They have Yeah, but then AC would be like, right up against the fence, and you only have Like a worker is gonna have all of six inches to move.

[Speaker 6]
Interesting.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. Stuff to think about. But

[Speaker 4]
Yeah,

[Speaker 2]
Not really deal breakers. Okay.

[Speaker 10]
But I do get a copy of this for sure. I'm gonna

[Speaker 4]
Email this to you. Okay. Yes, I will.

[Speaker 2]
Cool.

[Speaker 4]
Do that. Shortly. Okay, so I'm gonna find out what the cost to hardwood is. Then you can decide once I get the cost, if you want to add that to the purchase contract, we are going to do the title.

[Speaker 2]
We're going to do the tile.

[Speaker 4]
Um everything else? I know this is just stuff for me to remember to find out. 20 foot wide timing Etc.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah,

[Speaker 4]
The walkthrough again, I will figure that out one way or the other. Paul is usually very good trying to accommodate certain things. If you cannot, I'll drive out

[Speaker 9]
There and I'll open them off the door. And we can do a quick little two or three.

[Speaker 2]
I just want to see take photos of like, he like

[Speaker 4]
Absolutely the only reason I don't, um, whiten that we do. I call for that to everybody. I truly couldn't time me wise but it's because I'm not concrete. Anyway else. Yeah, of course, I meant stuff but it's only host for a long time but I don't want to start say I'll do a walkthrough with everybody and I'm on construction and so then maybe I can't answer questions properly and I don't want to give the wrong answers.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah that's why I

[Speaker 4]
It's good that construction does the walkthroughs but

[Speaker 2]
I'm not like I I don't I

[Speaker 3]
Like,

[Speaker 2]
I mean, the only thing that I would possibly ever suggest changing is if I saw something that's going to be a fire hazard, or

[Speaker 4]
It was also been glaringly wrong. Yeah. But

[Speaker 2]
Again, it has

[Speaker 4]
To be inspected by the city of archery. So it cannot be, you know, fun? Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Wow. Of course, but I

[Speaker 4]
Hear what you're saying but, um, yeah, I mean,

[Speaker 2]
Condo as that I have to sell. Have. Take out all the iot light switches. A light switch pet box that has five wires going in as a junction and that's signed off by the city of Calgary.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, really. Well

[Speaker 4]
I get it. I get it. Electrical is something you care about? Yeah, well people don't you do I absolutely get it and you can't see it once it's drywall. So it makes sense to me. Okay, so leave this with me if I get this price, uh, for the hardwood. You know, before my office closes at five, I'll get it all done today. If not perfect, I'll do it tomorrow,

[Speaker 2]
Cool, it's

[Speaker 4]
Yours. So don't worry about that. Um, so it'll be a tomorrow or a two-day thing, okay?

[Speaker 2]
Okay, and then

[Speaker 4]
Once I do send you the contract,

[Speaker 6]
You

[Speaker 4]
Can't take a week to sign it, but you can take it. Whether it's today or tomorrow. So if you want to take, you know, the day the evening to to go through it, that's fine. Reach out to me questions. Absolutely. Uh we just can't sort of have it pending for, you know, three days, four days, but 24 hours is fine cool. Okay, and so the five

[Speaker 2]
Thousand dollars that's the deposit for the the contract. And so if I if I'm like hey I can't wave conditions because whatever does that just disappear? If

[Speaker 4]
Something, you know, happens that um you didn't anticipate, um, then that is refunded to you, okay? Yeah, the only

[Speaker 3]
Thing

[Speaker 2]
That I can think of, that's

[Speaker 3]
See

[Speaker 2]
Well. I am. 17 days away from being two years at my company and so Banks really like that two-year. Whatever, but I think I found a bank that's fine with

[Speaker 3]
And

[Speaker 4]
Again, we have some next summer anyways. So I mean You know, your mortgage to be finalized.

[Speaker 2]
Yes, it was so,

[Speaker 4]
So, yeah, leave this with me.

[Speaker 2]
No. I actually thought you guys wanted it finalized, which was like, I was trying to find banks that would finalize. Well, I

[Speaker 4]
Mean yes and no, but when we're talking about, if this was going to be done in two months, okay, that's a different story. But if we're talking about next summer, you know, you might want to shop around see what happens with the rates. So, I mean, I just want to make sure that you have Yeah, the last thing I want is for someone to buy the home and they can't close next summer that's all but if you're comfortable.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, so yeah, leave these for the next, uh, rest of the day and possibly tomorrow, as soon as I have it ready to go, I will pick it up to you. Maybe go to school.

[Speaker 2]
Your sign out project there you can. Waterfield would not open the Sun becoming sunshine. Yeah,

[Speaker 3]
Well, I

[Speaker 4]
Know. And I've told my construction, guys, can you please get rid of him? It's just a little cumbersome for me

[Speaker 3]
Because my own doesn't sit in my car. I threw it on the side at one point, but they keep putting it back. I know.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, they're coming soon. I was like I drove around the first time I came here. Probably six times looking for the ohms. Well now, you know, yes, awesome. Good to see you. We'll chat later, thanks. Yeah. Talk to you later. Cheers. Bye.
