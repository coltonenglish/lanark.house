This repository and site serve as a way to document and inventory every step of my new home purchase process.

## Motivation

While searching for a new home, I realized that for "just a little bit more," building a new house could be within reach. In the process, I've met many talented and motivated individuals eager to help bring this vision to life. Unfortunately, the property I’m most drawn to is being sold by a builder whose representative has, on several occasions, provided incorrect or misleading information.

This site will capture both the journey of acquiring the property and the initial plans for building or customizing it. Once the home purchase is completed, **lanark.house** will evolve to serve as a virtual hub for my home, similar to my [hiddenleaf.network](https://hiddenleaf.network) page.

## Contents

- **Documentation**: Notes on each step of the purchase process, including key decisions and lessons learned.
- **Resources**: Links and contact information for the individuals and companies involved.
- **Updates**: Progress updates on the property acquisition and any building or renovation work.
- **Attestations**: GitHub attestations that capture and track any alterations to key documents and correspondence. These attestations ensure that any changes—especially from the builder—are documented and preserved for accountability.

## Builder and HOA Information

- **Builder**: Douglas Homes LTD
- **Builder’s Representative**: [Trish Braun](mailto:Trish.braun@shaw.ca)
- **Homeowners Association (HOA)**: Managed by Core Management, with Lesley Thompson as the point of contact.

For further HOA details, I’ve [kept private documentation](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12mOVpt3Z3Fo_Ow8LtMvxJz_7zgvSWNAO?usp=sharing) and correspondence related to HOA fees, community guidelines, and other key aspects to refer back to during the purchase and after closing.
Frusteratingly, Trish was quite insistent that there was not a management company made me feel bad for asking for "something no-one else has ever needed".

Stay tuned for more updates as the process unfolds!
