Home insurance is a must-have, and your lender will require you to have it in place before they release the mortgage funds. For a new build, the process is a little different than for a resale home.

I started by getting quotes from a few different insurance companies. I made sure to provide them with all the details of the new build, including the square footage, the number of bathrooms, and the type of heating system.

One thing to keep in mind is that you'll need a "course of construction" policy if you're building a custom home. For a production builder, you'll typically just need a standard homeowner's policy that takes effect on the closing date. It's always a good idea to confirm the requirements with your lender and your lawyer.
