Moving day can be one of the most stressful parts of the home-buying process. But with a little planning, it can also be a smooth and exciting experience.

Here are a few tips that helped me on moving day:

*   **Hire a reputable moving company:** Get quotes from a few different companies and check their references.
*   **Start packing early:** Don't leave everything to the last minute. Start with items you don't use every day and work your way up to the essentials.
*   **Label your boxes:** This will make unpacking so much easier. Be sure to label the contents of each box and the room it belongs in.
*   **Pack a "first night" box:** This should include all the essentials you'll need for your first night in your new home, like toiletries, a change of clothes, and snacks.
*   **Take your time:** Don't try to do everything in one day. Unpacking can take a while, so be patient and enjoy the process of setting up your new home.
