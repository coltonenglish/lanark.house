With a solid offer from TD in hand, the path forward is becoming clearer. The 4.09% 3-year fixed rate, combined with the insurance savings and cashback, presents a strong case.

The next steps involve:

1.  **Final Lender Comparison:** While the TD offer is compelling, I'll complete my due diligence by comparing it against offers from other lenders to ensure I'm making the most informed decision.
2.  **Formal Pre-Approval:** Once a lender is chosen, I will need to go through the formal pre-approval process. This will involve a more detailed look at my finances and will result in a firm commitment from the lender.
3.  **Signing with the Builder:** With financing secured, I can confidently move forward with signing the final purchase agreement with the new builder.

This stage is all about careful consideration and making sure all the pieces align. The financing is a cornerstone of the entire process, and getting it right is essential for long-term peace of mind.
