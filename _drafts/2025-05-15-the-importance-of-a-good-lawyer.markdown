While the builder and the bank are the two players you interact with the most, there's a third crucial member of your home-buying team: the real estate lawyer. Their role is to protect your interests and ensure that the legal transfer of the property goes smoothly.

I started my search for a lawyer by asking for recommendations from friends and colleagues. I also did some online research, looking for lawyers who specialize in residential real estate in my area.
