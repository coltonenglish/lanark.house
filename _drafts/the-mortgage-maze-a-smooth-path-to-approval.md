Securing a mortgage is one of the most stressful parts of buying a home. It's a whirlwind of paperwork, credit checks, and anxious waiting. Having gone through the process before, I was prepared for a bumpy ride. My experience with Sterling Homes, however, was anything but.

I was working with two lenders, ATB and CIBC, to ensure I was getting the best possible terms. This added a layer of complexity to the process, as it meant coordinating with two different institutions, each with its own set of requirements. Sterling Homes handled this with remarkable ease.

My primary contact, Jason Tang, was a model of efficiency. He was in constant communication with my mortgage advisor at CIBC, Heather Hannah, providing her with all the necessary documentation, from the purchase agreement to the appraisal contact information. The email chains from this period are a testament to a seamless, collaborative process. There were no delays, no missed documents, and no last-minute scrambles.

On May 21, 2025, I received the official `ApprovalLetter_ENGLISH2190649042.pdf` from CIBC. It was a moment of triumph and relief. The process had been so smooth, so devoid of the usual stress and drama, that it felt almost anticlimactic.

This experience stood in stark contrast to my previous attempts at securing financing. With other builders, I had been met with impatience and a lack of support. With Sterling, I felt like I had a team working with me, a team that understood the importance of clear communication and efficient execution. It was another powerful signal that I had made the right choice. The path to mortgage approval wasn't a maze at all; it was a straight line.
