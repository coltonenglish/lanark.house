Closing day is the day you've been waiting for! It's the day you officially become a homeowner. But there are a few things that need to happen before you get the keys.

A few days before closing, you'll meet with your lawyer to sign all the final paperwork. This will include the mortgage documents and the title transfer. You'll also need to provide a bank draft for the remaining down payment and closing costs.

On the day of closing, your lawyer will handle the transfer of funds to the builder's lawyer. Once the funds have been received, the builder will release the keys. It's a whirlwind of a day, but it's also incredibly exciting.
