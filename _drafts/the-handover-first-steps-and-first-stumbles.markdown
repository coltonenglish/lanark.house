June 2nd, 2025, was possession day. The culmination of a month of smooth, professional, and almost surprisingly pleasant interactions with Sterling Homes. The sales process, led by Jason Tang, had been a masterclass in how to build trust. The home inspection had been flawless. I walked into the final handover meeting with a sense of optimism and excitement.

This meeting marked a significant shift. The sales team, with whom I had built a strong rapport, was now handing me off to the service team. This is where I met Mike for the first time. The energy in the room changed immediately. Where Jason had been patient and collaborative, Mike was brisk and dismissive.

The first sign of trouble was small, but telling. I noticed that the doors on the stacking washer and dryer were hinged on opposite sides, making it awkward to move clothes from one to the other. I pointed this out and asked if it was something that could be fixed before I moved in.

Instead of acknowledging the inconvenience or simply explaining that it wasn't possible, Mike's response was to tell me I was wrong for thinking the doors should align. It was a bizarre and unnecessarily defensive reaction. A simple "no, that's how they come from the manufacturer" would have sufficed. Instead, I was made to feel like my reasonable observation was an unreasonable complaint.

It was a jarring interaction that stood in stark contrast to every other conversation I'd had with Sterling. It was the first time I felt like my concerns weren't being heard, but rather, deflected.

I left the handover with the keys to my new home, but also with a sense of unease. The seamless, positive experience I had come to expect from Sterling had hit its first bump in the road. I didn't know it at the time, but this interaction was not an anomaly; it was a preview of the frustrating and dysfunctional post-possession service that was to come.
