**Subject: Dispute Regarding Purchase Agreement - [Your Name] - [Your Lot/Address if applicable]**

**Dear Ms. Myers,**

I am writing to formally express my significant concerns and dissatisfaction regarding discrepancies and communication issues related to my recent purchase agreement with Jayman Built. While I was initially excited about building my home with Jayman, the experience thus far has unfortunately led to considerable frustration and concern, primarily centered around the specifications of the ensuite shower.

I wish to outline my grievances clearly below:

**Grievances**

1.  **Integrity and Advertising Discrepancy:** Jayman's publicly available [style guide](https://www.jayman.com/assets/Uploads/JAY-2609-Fit-and-Finish-Brochure-CAL_WEB_2025.pdf) explicitly states: "4-piece ensuites include curbless tiled shower recessed into the floor sloped towards a 32” linear drain. Walls are tiled to ceiling. Includes 80” height, chrome frame, 10 mil glass shower door." This specification is not disclaimed in my purchase agreement, which references this style guide as "the brochure." While I understand the selected home layout (Avid 20 with revised ensuite) may present architectural challenges for a recessed floor, I firmly believe a company valuing integrity has an obligation to transparently communicate significant deviations between advertised features and the final product offered in a purchase agreement. The subsequent quote of nearly $7,000 CAD to upgrade to the advertised 80" height and 10 mil glass feels exploitative, especially since the existence of this upgrade confirms the architectural viability of at least these key advertised components.

2.  **Contractual Ambiguity and Legal Entitlement:** Based on the advertised specifications in the brochure (referenced in the purchase agreement) and the upgrades I agreed to ($7,820 for the "Revised Ensuite" creating a 4-piece ensuite, and $12,600 for "Fit and Finish Extra (2)"), I interpreted the contract to include the advertised 80" height, 10 mil glass shower. The contract defines a 4-piece ensuite simply as having a "separate soaker tub & shower" (Addendum B, Page 4). My specific floor plan marks a 42"x48" shower within this 4-piece ensuite configuration. The subsequent claim by sales staff that the advertised specification applies only to a single model in one location suggests the advertisement, lacking qualifiers, may be materially false and used as a bad-faith inducement. Given the contractual ambiguity, under the principle of *contra proferentem*, I believe my interpretation is reasonable and legally defensible. I feel I have fulfilled my contractual obligations to be entitled to the advertised 4-piece ensuite shower specifications.

3.  **Lack of Defined Specification Post-Signing:** There is a concerning lack of clarity regarding the ensuite shower Jayman intends to build. The only explicit definition for an 80" high, 10 mil glass shower (42"x48") appears in the style guide referenced by the contract. Post-signing, I received conflicting specifications via email from the sales associate: initially 70" height/5 mil glass (April 10th), then revised to 75" height/6 mil glass (April 11th) [cite: 606-608, 654-656]. No contractual basis for either a 70" or 75" specification exists in the signed documents. When challenged, the sales associate vaguely cited Addendum B, page 4, point 3 ("other shower stalls applicable to plan") without pointing to any document defining this 75" shower [cite: 646-647]. This ambiguity and the shifting specifications provided after signing are unacceptable. I now require absolute clarity and formal documentation before proceeding further.

4.  **Delayed Management Response and Interference:** Following the inability to resolve this with the sales associate, I requested escalation to Sales Manager Michael Klassen on April 11th. Despite assurances and multiple follow-ups [cite: 669-671, 381-382, 658-660], Mr. Klassen failed to initiate contact for over 16 days. It required a direct email from me on April 27th, expressing concern about the delay's impact on good faith, to finally receive a response. This unacceptable delay from management significantly hindered timely clarification and resolution, causing undue stress and interfering with potential contract amendments or mediation processes.

**Remediations Sought**

I am seeking a resolution that upholds the reasonable expectations set by your company's marketing and the terms of our agreement.

Without prejudice, while I understand that the discrepancy regarding the shower specifications *could* stem from an internal error of communication between Jayman's marketing and sales departments, this possibility does not negate the impact on me as the customer. **I must be firm and direct: I will not be held financially liable for any such internal error.** Furthermore, this entire situation and the difficulty in resolving it were significantly **exacerbated by the lack of timely and quality communication on the part of the Sales Manager, Michael Klassen.**

Therefore, I request the following specific remediations:

1.  **Provision of the 80" Ensuite Shower:** Jayman Built honours the reasonable interpretation of the contract and advertised specifications by providing the 4-piece ensuite shower with the following features at no additional cost beyond what is already stipulated in the purchase agreement:
    * Dimensions: 42" x 48" base.
    * Height: 80" from threshold.
    * Glass: 10 mil clear glass.
    * Frame: Chrome frame at top and sides only.
    * Handle: 8" D handle.
2.  **Formal Documentation:** The exact model number and detailed design specifications for the agreed-upon 80", 10 mil shower configuration are documented clearly in a formal amendment to the purchase agreement.
3.  **Confirmation of Tankless Water Heater:** Written confirmation, via a contract amendment, that the home will include the Navien NPE 240A tankless water heater as specified in Addendum B, Page 4, referenced in the purchase agreement.
4.  **Review of Advertising Practices:** For the benefit of future customers and to uphold Jayman's stated value of integrity, I urge you to review your marketing materials (including the Fit and Finish brochure) to ensure they accurately reflect standard specifications and clearly disclose variations or limitations based on home model or location. This includes removing potentially misleading statements and ensuring sales staff provide accurate information.

I believe these requests are fair and necessary to rectify the current situation and restore my confidence in Jayman Built. I look forward to your prompt response and a constructive dialogue to resolve these matters amicably.

Sincerely,
