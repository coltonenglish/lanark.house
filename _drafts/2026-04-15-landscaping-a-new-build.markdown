One of the biggest projects with a new build is the landscaping. You're starting with a blank slate, which can be both exciting and daunting.

My first step was to create a plan. I thought about how I wanted to use the space and what kind of plants would thrive in my climate. I also considered things like drainage and irrigation.

I decided to tackle the landscaping in phases. The first phase was to install the hardscaping, like the patio and walkways. The second phase was to plant the trees and shrubs. And the final phase was to plant the flowers and lay the sod.

It was a lot of work, but it was also incredibly rewarding. There's nothing quite like seeing your dream yard come to life.
