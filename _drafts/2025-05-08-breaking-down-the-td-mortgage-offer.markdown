Following my initial inquiry, Alex Sayidiy from TD provided a comprehensive mortgage offer. Having the concrete numbers is a huge step forward and allows for more accurate financial planning.

Here are the key details of the offer:

*   **Interest Rate:** 4.09% (3-year fixed)
*   **Amortization:** 30 years
*   **Down Payment:** The rate holds even for down payments under 20%.
*   **Insurance Savings:** A significant benefit is the potential savings of approximately **$14,000** in mortgage default insurance fees. This is a major advantage when putting less than 20% down.
*   **Cashback Incentive:** TD is also offering **$1,000 cashback** upon closing.

This offer is quite competitive, especially with the insurance savings and cashback. A 3-year fixed term provides a good balance of stability without locking in for too long in the current market. Now, it's time to compare this with other lenders and make a final decision.
