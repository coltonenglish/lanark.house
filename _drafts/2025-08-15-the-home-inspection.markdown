Even though it's a brand new home, a home inspection is still a crucial step. A good inspector will identify any potential issues, from minor cosmetic flaws to more significant structural problems. This is your last chance to have the builder address any issues before you take possession.

I hired an inspector who had experience with new construction. They knew what to look for and were able to identify a few minor issues that I had missed. The builder was happy to fix them before closing.

The inspection report is also a valuable document to have for your records. It provides a snapshot of the condition of your home at the time of purchase and can be useful for future maintenance and repairs.
