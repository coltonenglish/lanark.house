I called Erin to follow up on an email I'd sent Saturday regarding the process for obtaining a waiver.  I explained I was hoping to move forward with the purchase and had signed the initial paperwork. I needed to present the waiver to the bank to responsibly represent the transaction, specifically addressing the eight-inch discrepancy.

Erin stated that they don't typically go into this level of detail with every purchaser and encouraged me to work with the builder, Trish.  She offered to inquire further, but noted the architectural controls were approved in July, and the house was already built.  She said they work with consultants who review the architectural controls, and those had been approved.

I pointed out that the approval included a stamp stating the builder was responsible for ensuring the building aligned with all covenants.  I stated this wasn't a waiver, as defined by Section 10 of the architectural guidelines, and asked again about the process to obtain one.

Erin said she would inquire further, admitting she hadn't encountered this request before. I acknowledged that I was sending this on the weekend, reiterating that I was trying to resolve this before approaching the bank for financing. Erin said she understood and appreciated my due diligence, noting that most buyers don't ask this many questions.  She explained she would need to check with the builder team and the architectural control team to learn more and would get back to me.

I asked for a timeframe, as I had a limited time to finalize the financing. Erin said she would make it a top priority and would get back to me as soon as possible, acknowledging it was Monday morning.

I expressed my appreciation for her responsiveness and we ended the call.
