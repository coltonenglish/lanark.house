Buying a home is supposed to be an exciting milestone—a mix of hope, anticipation, and planning for the future. But sometimes, it’s the smallest details that unravel everything.

In early November 2024, I put down a deposit on a new build with Douglas Homes. The process started with optimism. My main contact, Trish Braun, seemed confident that things would go smoothly. But that confidence soon gave way to frustration.

The first red flag came when I asked for a sample purchase contract before signing. I was met with resistance. Transparency felt scarce, and that unease lingered. As someone used to clear communication and openness in my work, this was unsettling.

Over the next few weeks, I raised several concerns—from warranty details to the odd choice of bathtub model. But the issue that ultimately ended the deal was an 8-inch discrepancy between the architectural guidelines and the as-built plot plan for the property. Eight inches might sound trivial, but in this case, it was a deal breaker.

I pushed for a formal waiver from the developer, Melcor, or the architectural committee, E2 and Associates, hoping to resolve the issue. Despite multiple calls and attempts to engage all parties, Douglas Homes refused to pursue a waiver or provide a clear resolution. The lack of transparency and unwillingness to address the problem left me feeling powerless.

Adding to the frustration were misrepresentations about HOA rules and restrictive covenants, and an unusual e-signing process through a numbered Alberta corporation rather than Douglas Homes’ official DocuSign system—raising questions about legitimacy and security.

After a final conversation on November 18, where Douglas Homes reiterated their refusal to provide a waiver, the deal collapsed on November 20. What began as an exciting step toward homeownership ended abruptly, leaving me to reflect on what went wrong.

This experience taught me that buying a home is more than a transaction—it’s a commitment that demands clear communication, transparency, and respect. It’s not about rushing into the flashiest option but about ensuring your concerns are heard and addressed.

For anyone navigating the home-buying journey, my advice is simple: insist on clarity. Ask for sample contracts, verify every detail, and demand formal resolutions to any discrepancies. Your future home deserves that level of care.

The process may be daunting, but each lesson learned brings you closer to the right place to call home.
