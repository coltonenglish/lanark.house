16:42:090 s2This is trash.  
16:42:100 s2Hello.  
16:42:111 s2This is trash.  
16:42:112 s1Hey Trish, Hello.  
16:42:136 s1Sorry, just, I just wanted to quickly touch base and see where, if you had a chance to, to look at that e-mail.  
16:42:200 s2Umm, sorry.  
16:42:211 s2Which e-mail?  
16:42:225 s1Uh, I sent one that was with, uh, I forwarded one that I had been conversing with Aaron.  
16:42:281 s2Oh yes, that one.  
16:42:281 s1Umm, crap.  
16:42:290 s2Yeah.  
16:42:292 s2So I did speak to my office.  
16:42:312 s2I was going to call you here in a couple of minutes.  
16:42:341 s1OK, perfect.  
16:42:354 s1Sorry, I, I just, I'm, I really was hoping to get a, a hold of the bank today.  
16:42:3511 s2Umm, so, yeah, so, uh, in speaking with the management group, uh, at head office, as I said, they, there's nothing more they can provide as it relates to this.  
16:42:452 s2They provide anything that they can.  
16:42:484 s2Umm, so it's up to your comfort level, if you're comfortable going ahead.  
16:42:523 s2Otherwise, you know, they can certainly refund your deposit.  
16:42:559 s2Umm no, no they don't.  
16:42:567 s1OK, They, they don't want to have a conversation with Melcor about, about actually just getting a written waiver.  
16:43:051 s1Uh, OK.  
16:43:073 s1And did they give a reason as to why?  
16:43:106 s2Because we've provided everything that we provide, uh, in this case, they own the land, They bought it from Melcor.  
16:43:162 s2It's plotted properly on the land.  
16:43:186 s2Uh, we've provided you with a plot plan showing the house on the land and it's already under construction.  
16:43:220 s1Sure.  
16:43:230 s1OK.  
16:43:243 s2So there's nothing more in this case that they would provide to a purchaser?  
16:43:291 s1Can you?  
16:43:308 s1Is there an e-mail from a Douglas holmes.net e-mail address that says we have plotted this properly on the line?  
16:43:3711 s2Again, the the direction that I received from management was to let you know that that is all they'll provider at this point and that they are certainly comfortable.  
16:43:491 s2You know, we're funding your deposit.  
16:43:5228 s1Mm hmm umm sorry, I'm just trying to think I interesting do this isn't the this isn't the pre sale thing, right Like this is you guys plotted it and.  
16:44:0511 s2No, he he also said that, you know, I mean, maybe a more sort of pre sale situation and more custom build type situation elsewhere might be might be something that would more align.  
16:44:198 s2No, no, he suggested that perhaps it might more align with what you're looking for to look elsewhere, right, for more of a pre sale custom situation.  
16:44:271 s2Umm, which is not this right.  
16:44:282 s2So that was just his recommendation.  
16:44:292 s1OK, right.  
16:44:326 s1OK, so let's go back to that numbered corporation just so that I can assess my risk level.  
16:44:370 s2What?  
16:44:3813 s2I'm sorry, what what number corporation, right.  
16:44:416 s1Umm, so OK, the emails that you have been sending have been coming from a personal e-mail address.  
16:44:487 s1Umm is OK.  
16:44:512 s2That's the e-mail I use to work when I'm working at home.  
16:44:531 s2That's correct.  
16:44:584 s1I just wanna be fully like, I'm gonna be really transparent.  
16:45:005 s2Again, so I and I completely understand Colton, but at this point, the options are moving ahead.  
16:45:053 s2Or again, we can certainly happily return your deposit.  
16:45:060 s1Mm hmm.  
16:45:087 s2There's not gonna be any more discussions about my DocuSign and the e-mail that it came from, umm, or any more discussions on the plotting of the house on the lot.  
16:45:151 s2It is what it is.  
16:45:162 s2And if you're comfortable, umm, you know, that's great.  
16:45:192 s2If not, we will happily refund your deposit.  
16:45:244 s1I understand what you were saying, but I wanna be really transparent.  
16:45:281 s1This is a recorded phone call.  
16:45:291 s2And that's fine.  
16:45:304 s2Again, I was, I was, I was, you know, that was the direction I was given.  
16:45:3111 s1And no, no, OK, I just want to make sure that like I would rather hold Douglas Holmes accountable rather than Trish Bran accountable.  
16:45:347 s2Umm, based on the communication that, but what is that called?  
16:45:421 s2What are you holding accountable?  
16:45:433 s2And why, I guess is we've provided everything that we need to.  
16:45:457 s1If if you guys are misrepresenting, right, because it is not.  
16:45:481 s2How am I misrepresenting?  
16:45:502 s2And again, I don't want to, I don't want to argue with you.  
16:45:523 s2It it's counterproductive to to you, to me, right?  
16:45:532 s1I'm not, I'm not trying to argue.  
16:45:558 s1I'm trying to have a conversation and you guys are shutting down you should you personally have shut down every conversation I've ever tried to have with you?  
16:46:032 s2Well, that is untrue, Colton, that is untrue.  
16:46:051 s2Umm, completely.  
16:46:066 s1I OK, Well, mm, hmm.  
16:46:077 s2So like I said, your options are we can we can return your deposit or you can be comfortable with the information that you have thus far.  
16:46:151 s2Those those are the options, right?  
16:46:160 s1Yeah.  
16:46:171 s2So there's no more.  
16:46:185 s1I mean, and, and I can also continue to try and work with Melcor, which I mean, they've been very responsive so far.  
16:46:212 s2Well, you're not buying a home from mail core.  
16:46:235 s2So just just so you know, the process builders purchase the land from Melcor.  
16:46:261 s1I do understand that.  
16:46:273 s1But Melcor is the holder of the caveat, right?  
16:46:304 s2So in speaking with Erin, she also said that she's provided everything she can.  
16:46:341 s2There is nothing further.  
16:46:354 s2So as much as you know it, it's certainly we can have a conversation.  
16:46:394 s2We're talking in circles because there's nothing more I can provide in this regard, right?  
16:46:432 s2Which is why I said that right out of the gate.  
16:46:454 s2So you would have to be comfortable with all the information that's been provided to you.  
16:46:508 s2Otherwise, like I said, we can, you know, you can look elsewhere and I would wish you the best of luck in looking for a home and maybe a custom home, you know, where you can plot.  
16:46:584 s1Again, I'm not I'm very happy with what you guys have plotted.  
16:46:581 s2It might be more of a, you know.  
16:47:023 s1I'm very, I'm actually very ecstatic what you have plotted.  
16:47:066 s1I just want to make sure that what you have plotted, even if you know, even if you guys were like, hey gold, we would really like to not work with you.  
16:47:123 s1Umm, but OK.  
16:47:131 s2That's not what I'm saying.  
16:47:142 s2I'm saying there's nothing more I can provide, right?  
16:47:161 s2So there isn't.  
16:47:188 s2So there's nothing more I can get either from milk or, nor from Douglas head office about the, the plotting of the house on the lot.  
16:47:263 s2We've given you everything that we, we can and then that's it.  
16:47:292 s2So again, so it's up to you if you're comfortable with that.  
16:47:321 s2Uh, that's great.  
16:47:326 s1So, so sorry.  
16:47:326 s2If not, like I said, perhaps another, you know, another builder, another situation might be a better fit for you and what your needs and wants are.  
16:47:3924 s1And just just to confirm one more time, you were saying that Douglas Homes is 100% confident that they have plotted this property, umm, with respect to all of the architectural guidelines presently registered on, on that, uh, on that property, correct.  
16:48:031 s2As far as I know, yes.  
16:48:046 s2I mean, is speaking with the developer and then looking at the plot plan, and because the home is already framed, I would have to say yes.  
16:48:100 s1Mm, hmm.  
16:48:152 s1I, I understand where the home is already framed.  
16:48:170 s1I get.  
16:48:172 s1I understand that that means that there's a sunk cost.  
16:48:221 s2That there's a what?  
16:48:220 s2Sorry.  
16:48:233 s1Have you have you there's already a sunk cost.  
16:48:255 s1And like it it like I, I agree, but this is almost entirely a non issue.  
16:48:301 s1It's a non issue with Melcor.  
16:48:323 s1I just wanna make sure it's a non issue with Colton English in five years, right?  
16:48:353 s2So again, it's to sell the property right now it's a non issue.  
16:48:394 s2So if you want to move forward, umm, again, that's your prerogative.  
16:48:433 s2If not, we can, we can cancel it and refund your deposit.  
16:48:462 s2But I, I can't provide any more info.  
16:48:470 s1OK.  
16:48:484 s2And I, you know, I don't want to just sort of again, talk in circles about this anymore.  
16:48:522 s2Again, not just for myself, but for you as well, right?  
16:48:553 s2Our, our time and energy could be certainly better spent, right?  
16:48:582 s2So, so that's sort of where it's sitting.  
16:48:592 s2And so I guess the ball is in your court.  
16:49:036 s1OK, umm, cool.  
16:49:102 s1Thank you for for this information.  
16:49:125 s1I will consider it and I will, you know, I'll reach out to, to Melcor, obviously to confirm.  
16:49:1713 s1Umm, But I I yeah, I I.  
16:49:173 s2Well, she did say that, I mean, and certainly, you know, you have her e-mail.  
16:49:202 s2You can, you can, you know, it's up to you to reach out to her.  
16:49:237 s2But, and when you purchase a home from Douglas Holmes, you know, the process not is not to reach out to milk or you're purchasing it from Douglas Holmes.  
16:49:301 s2Uh, she's awesome.  
16:49:313 s2She can certain, you know, she's provided you with a lot of information and that's fantastic.  
16:49:353 s2Umm, in speaking with her, she did say that's, that's pretty much it.  
16:49:382 s2I mean, she doesn't have anything else to, to provide to you, right?  
16:49:403 s2So, umm, that was the conversation I had with her a couple hours ago.  
16:49:432 s2So I mean, it's certainly your prerogative.  
16:49:451 s2I mean, you're a free man.  
16:49:469 s1OK, sure, and I'm like, I'm feeling that you are are feeling attacked.  
16:49:4615 s2You can e-mail her if you want to, but umm, you know, that was what she had said to me, of course.  
16:49:553 s1I'm really trying to make sure that this is just the best experience for all of us.  
16:49:5912 s1Umm, obviously myself first, but like, but the, the thing that I'm, I like, like, I'm not asking for like anything other than a written confirmation that is documented.  
16:50:127 s1It's, it's outlined in, in the bylaws for the, for that piece of titled land.  
16:50:194 s1Umm, and it's, it's well documented exactly what needs to happen here.  
16:50:2315 s1So even if I were to pull out Douglas, it is obligated to provide that to whoever purchases, uh, if they're selling in good faith, which I'm trying really hard to believe that you are, I think that, you know, I, I, I obviously think that you guys are selling in good faith.  
16:50:394 s1Otherwise I would have hung up the phone hours ago and I would just, you know, not have been working with you guys.  
16:50:436 s1But I just like this is something where, you know, there's a, a again, it's 8 inches.  
16:50:491 s1I get that.  
16:50:507 s1It's I, I just, I'm, I'm not sure.  
16:50:564 s2Like I said, and like I said about, you know, we're, we're going back and forth here.  
16:51:003 s2We're not getting anywhere in in, in the conversation as it relates to that.  
16:51:023 s2So they have provided everything that they can provide.  
16:51:043 s1Mm Hmm, OK.  
16:51:053 s2So there's nothing further that they're, you know, that they're able to provide.  
16:51:075 s1Can you sorry and I know that you don't want to talk about this anymore.  
16:51:124 s1Do you mind just telling me what you've told umm, is it Doug's deal?  
16:51:151 s2I shared the e-mail thread.  
16:51:160 s2Yeah.  
16:51:170 s2Yeah.  
16:51:173 s2So they know exactly what you're concerned, correct?  
16:51:187 s1OK, so you shared the e-mail thread and he, he just said, hey, like we don't we don't want to provide any more documentation.  
16:51:208 s2Yeah, they don't have, they don't have anything further to provide.  
16:51:252 s1We're not going to have this.  
16:51:283 s2As I said, yeah, I shared with them your questions and concerns.  
16:51:309 s1I, OK, so they, they, and they don't want to generate a, an extra document with Melcor that says, hey, we're OK.  
16:51:316 s2Umm, they they will not.  
16:51:373 s2No, no, that's not something that, uh, there's protocol for.  
16:51:401 s2They will not.  
16:51:423 s1I understand there's not protocol, but there's legal precedents.  
16:51:453 s1Actually, there is protocol because that's what section 10 describes.  
16:51:482 s2So they, they again, and I did share all of that with them.  
16:51:496 s1But yeah.  
16:51:502 s2I wasn't just a quick phone conversation.  
16:51:522 s2I certainly take it seriously, right?  
16:51:540 s2Of course.  
16:51:541 s2And you're concerned seriously.  
16:51:556 s2So I shared the e-mail thread, uh, in addition to having a phone conversation as we were both looking at it, right?  
16:51:570 s1Mm, hmm.  
16:52:015 s2So, uh, so that's what was, you know, uh, came back to me and, and that's what I shared with you on the phone.  
16:52:063 s2So that's up to you, OK?  
16:52:080 s1OK.  
16:52:091 s1I appreciate it.  
16:52:104 s1I really have enjoyed, you know, I, I, I enjoy working with you.  
16:52:1415 s1Umm, I think that that there have been a couple of things where I would like to provide feedback, umm, if I do decide to, to move forward with this, which I mean, still in my head, it's a 5050.  
16:52:171 s2Yeah, absolutely.  
16:52:181 s2And it's my job to try to.  
16:52:292 s1It's been a 5050 all weekend.  
16:52:302 s1Obviously there's a lot of anxiety here.  
16:52:338 s1Uh, I have a bottle of, of Estonian, umm, uh, rhubarb gin that I would love to crack open.  
16:52:411 s1Umm, if you're interested.  
16:52:436 s1But O, obviously I'm gonna, I'm gonna phone Aaron and try and figure this out just a little bit more before I make that final decision.  
16:52:504 s1I'm, I'm genuinely not trying to like put you guys into a bad position.  
16:52:544 s1I'm trying to make it so that everybody is protected in perpetuity, right?  
16:52:580 s1Mm hmm.  
16:52:590 s2Yeah.  
16:52:591 s2Oh, no, I understand that.  
16:53:0011 s2So why don't we say, you know, take the, the evening, if that makes sense to you, uh, make your final decision and let me know if we decide to, you know, to part ways and have you look for, for something else.  
16:53:113 s2Umm, I would just be DocuSign and do what's called a non waiver.  
16:53:143 s2Just so obviously there's a termination of the contract to protect you.  
16:53:180 s1OK.  
16:53:193 s2OK, Yeah, no worries, Golden.  
16:53:200 s1Thank you.  
16:53:221 s2Thanks so much.  
16:53:230 s1Yeah.  
16:53:240 s1Cheers.  
16:53:240 s1Bye.
