I called E2 and Associates regarding the eight-inch discrepancy between the spec home and the architectural guidelines. I explained that the builder, Douglas Homes, was unwilling to request a waiver and that I needed the waiver to proceed with financing. I asked to speak with someone who could help create a waiver for the discrepancy.

The representative offered to take my information and flag the issue as urgent. She confirmed my contact information and the address of the property in question: Phase 4, Block 13, Lot 1 of Lanark Landing, with a property address of 204 Langwell Common SE. She clarified that I was requesting an architectural guidance waiver for the plans.

I confirmed and explained that the spec home was built eight inches narrower than permitted by the guidelines, and Douglas Homes didn't want to contact E2 to resolve the issue. They were asking me to either accept the discrepancy and risk having to change it later or find someone else to handle the process.

The representative confirmed my phone numbers and email address and said she would forward the message to the appropriate team. She said a representative would return my call within 24 hours. I thanked her and we ended the call.
