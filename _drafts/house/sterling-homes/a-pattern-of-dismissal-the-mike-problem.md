If the Virtuo app was the technological barrier to getting service, Mike was the human one. My interactions with him went beyond a simple personality clash; they revealed a consistent pattern of dismissive, deceptive, and unprofessional behavior that shattered my trust in Sterling's commitment to post-possession service.

The incident with the washer/dryer door on possession day was just the beginning. A few days later, I discovered a small, 3mm piece of cracked plastic on one of the new appliances. The broken piece had been carefully set back in place, a tiny act of deception designed to hide the defect. When I pointed this out to Mike, his response was not an apology or an offer to replace it, but a shrug. It was a small issue, but the attempt to conceal it spoke volumes.

The most telling interaction, however, happened during a walkthrough with Mike and his colleague, Yaz. Yaz, who was consistently professional and helpful, pointed out a dark spot on the ceiling, a clear, visible water stain. Before she could even finish her sentence, Mike talked over her, dismissing it as a shadow or a trick of the light. It was a blatant attempt to downplay a valid concern, and it was deeply uncomfortable to witness. He wasn't just dismissive of me, the customer; he was dismissive of his own team member who was trying to do the right thing.

These incidents, taken together, painted a clear picture. Mike's primary focus was not on solving problems, but on deflecting them. His communication style was designed to make me feel like my concerns were invalid, to put me on the defensive, and to create an environment where it was easier to give up than to fight for a resolution.

Transparency and honesty are core values of mine. The pattern of behavior I witnessed from Mike was a direct violation of those values. He may not be a bad person, but his approach to customer service is fundamentally flawed. He is the human embodiment of a process designed to frustrate, and he is the primary reason I would hesitate to ever deal with Sterling Homes again.
