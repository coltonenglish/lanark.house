The journey to homeownership doesn’t end when you get the keys. In many ways, it’s just the beginning. The first year in a new home is a learning experience, a time of settling in, and, inevitably, a period of discovering the small imperfections that come with any new build. My experience with Sterling Homes was a reminder that even a smooth and transparent purchase process can be followed by a post-possession phase with its own set of challenges.

The initial sales and closing process with Sterling was a breath of fresh air. The team was communicative, transparent, and professional. I felt confident and excited about my new home at 728 Langley Terrace. But as I settled in, the realities of new homeownership began to surface.

One of the first challenges was the Virtuo app, a platform designed to streamline communication and service requests. In theory, it was a great idea. In practice, it was a source of frustration. The app was plagued with inaccuracies, synchronization issues, and lost data. What was meant to be a tool for clear communication became a barrier to it.

This experience highlighted the importance of having multiple channels of communication with your builder. Technology can be a powerful tool, but it’s not always reliable. It’s essential to have a direct line to the people who can help you when issues arise.

The first year also brought a series of warranty and repair issues, from minor drywall touch-ups to more significant items like eavestrough and fireplace repairs. Navigating this process required patience, persistence, and meticulous record-keeping. Each issue was a lesson in the importance of staying on top of scheduling, following up on communications, and advocating for your needs as a homeowner.

The contrast between the smooth purchase process and the challenging post-possession phase was stark. It was a reminder that the home-buying journey has many chapters. The initial purchase is just the first. The real story of homeownership unfolds in the months and years that follow.

For any new homeowner, my advice is this: be prepared for the unexpected. The first year will likely bring a few surprises. Stay organized, communicate clearly, and don’t be afraid to be persistent. And remember, every challenge is a learning opportunity, a chance to become a more informed and empowered homeowner.
