As part of the home completion, the roof final and cleaning are still pending. This is an important step to ensure the longevity and proper functioning of the roofing system, as well as to maintain the aesthetic appeal of the property. I am currently awaiting an update on when this work will be scheduled.

**Next Steps:** I will follow up to request an update on the roof final and cleaning schedule. It's important to ensure this is completed promptly to avoid any potential issues down the line.
