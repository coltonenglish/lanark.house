title: "Parging: Reviewing Documentation for Completion"
---

Parging is an important exterior finish that protects the foundation. I am currently in the process of reviewing the documentation related to the parging work to confirm its completion and ensure it meets the required standards. This is part of my due diligence to ensure all aspects of the home's construction are properly finalized.

**Next Steps:** I will continue reviewing the documentation regarding parging to confirm its completion. If any discrepancies are found, I will follow up accordingly.
