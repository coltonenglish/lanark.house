title: "The Fireplace Saga: Awaiting Missing Crystals and a Spark"
---

My new home's fireplace, a focal point I envisioned for cozy evenings, is currently missing its decorative crystals and, more importantly, isn't turning on. This is a minor but persistent issue that I've been tracking. An appointment with Enercare is now scheduled for August 7th. I'm hopeful that this visit will finally resolve the issue, allowing me to fully enjoy the ambiance of a working fireplace.

**Next Steps:** Enercare is scheduled to complete the repair on August 7th. I will ensure I am available for their visit and confirm the repair is successful.
