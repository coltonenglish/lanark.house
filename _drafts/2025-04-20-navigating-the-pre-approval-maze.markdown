Getting pre-approved for a mortgage is one of the most important first steps in the home-buying process. It's not just about knowing how much you can afford; it's also about showing sellers and builders that you're a serious buyer.

My journey started with reaching out to multiple lenders, including my primary bank and mortgage specialists like Alex at TD. I gathered all the necessary documents: proof of income, bank statements, and information about any existing debts.

One tip I learned is to get pre-approvals from a few different lenders. This allows you to compare rates and terms, and it gives you leverage in negotiations. It's also important to understand the difference between a pre-qualification and a pre-approval. A pre-approval is a much more formal commitment from the lender and carries more weight.
