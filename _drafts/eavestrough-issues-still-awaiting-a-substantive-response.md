title: "Eavestrough Issues: Still Awaiting a Substantive Response, Despite Claims of a 'Fix'"
---

The eavestrough issues at my property continue to be a source of significant frustration. Despite a recent claim of a "fix," I have yet to receive a substantive response or a clear plan of action from the warranty team that addresses my underlying concerns about proper drainage and long-term integrity.

My initial concerns about the eavestrough were raised on June 30, 2025, when I reported "improperly sloped, leading to persistent pooling of water" on the southwest corner. I highlighted potential issues such as "Ice Formation," "Water Damage," and "Pest Attraction," and requested an inspection and repairs.

On July 11, 2025, after a series of exchanges and a feeling of "not yet properly gotten a response," I expressed my frustration to Jaspreet Gill, noting "I'm seeing the potential impact of the poor eavestrough installation with water escaping. There is a 90 degree joint that does not properly appear to be cut and jointed." I even requested to be directed to the manufacturer's documentation to understand proper installation, stating, "Given the many issues, I'm wondering if it needs to be entirely revisited."

Later that same day, Don Allary from Empire Envelope, who was CC'd on the email thread, sent a terse reply: "We have fix the drainage issue with the eavestrough." While a "fix" was claimed, the brevity of the response and the lack of detail left me with more questions than answers. It did not address my concerns about the 90-degree joint, the potential for water escaping, or the long-term compliance with code.

This ongoing lack of a comprehensive explanation or a detailed resolution plan is concerning. Proper eavestrough function is critical for the long-term integrity of the home, and a simple "fix" without addressing the root cause or providing assurance of compliance is insufficient.

**Next Steps:** I will continue to pursue a comprehensive resolution for the eavestrough issues. I need a clear and substantive response outlining the proposed solution, addressing my specific concerns about the jointing and water escape, and providing a timeline for its implementation. I may also need to independently verify the quality and compliance of the "fix" if a detailed explanation is not provided.
