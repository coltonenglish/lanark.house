title: "Eavestrough Issues: Still Awaiting a Substantive Response"
---

One of the ongoing frustrations I've encountered relates to the eavestrough issues at my property. Despite my previous attempts to raise these concerns, I have yet to receive a substantive response or a clear plan of action from the warranty team. This lack of progress is concerning, as proper eavestrough function is critical for the long-term integrity of the home.

**Next Steps:** I will continue to pursue a resolution for the eavestrough issues. I need a clear and substantive response outlining the proposed solution and a timeline for its implementation.
