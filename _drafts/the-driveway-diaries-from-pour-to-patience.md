title: "The Driveway Diaries: From Pour to Patience"
---

Today, July 24, 2025, marks a significant milestone: the concrete for my driveway and walkway was finally poured. This is a crucial step in completing the exterior of my home. While the immediate gratification of a finished driveway is tempting, I understand the importance of the curing process. I've set reminders to guide my usage over the coming weeks.

**Next Steps:** I will be diligently monitoring the curing process. I anticipate being able to drive a small personal vehicle on it (but not park) by August 3rd or 7th, and expect the concrete to reach its full strength, allowing for all vehicle use, by August 21st. Patience is key here to ensure the longevity of the concrete.
