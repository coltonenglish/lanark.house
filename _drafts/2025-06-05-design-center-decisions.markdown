One of the most exciting parts of buying a new build is visiting the design center. This is where you get to choose all the finishes and upgrades that will make your house a home. From flooring and cabinets to countertops and light fixtures, the options can be overwhelming.

I went into my design center appointment with a clear budget and a good idea of the style I wanted to achieve. I had created a mood board with images from magazines and Pinterest to help guide my choices.

It's easy to get carried away in the design center, so it's important to stick to your budget. I focused on upgrades that would add the most value and that would be difficult or expensive to change later, like flooring and kitchen cabinets. For smaller things, like paint colors and light fixtures, I knew I could always update them myself down the road.
