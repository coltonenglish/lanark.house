title: "Mike's Dangerous Negligence: The Foam Wall Fiasco"
---

The excitement of moving into a new home is something I had been looking forward to for a long time. After a long and arduous journey with two other builders, I was finally at the finish line with Sterling Homes. Possession day, June 2nd, was supposed to be a day of celebration. Instead, it was a day of frustration and a stark reminder that even in a mostly positive experience, you can still encounter dangerous negligence.

One of the outstanding items on the possession list was the foam insulation for the basement party wall. This was something that was supposed to be completed before I moved in, but for reasons that were never made clear, it was delayed until the day I was set to take possession.

I was assured by Mike, the site supervisor, that this would be a quick and painless process. "It'll only take about half an hour," he said, with a casual wave of his hand. His nonchalant attitude gave me no reason to doubt him. I trusted that he, as the builder's representative, was giving me accurate information.

However, when the installation crew arrived, they told a very different story. They informed me that the process would take significantly longer than half an hour. More alarmingly, they warned me that the foam would off-gas for approximately 24 hours and that it would be unsafe to stay in the house during that time.

I was floored. Mike had not only misled me about the time commitment, but he had also completely omitted the crucial safety information about the off-gassing. He was perfectly willing to let me, and anyone else in the house, be exposed to potentially harmful fumes. This wasn't just an inconvenience; it was a dangerous situation created by his negligence.

This incident was a harsh reminder that you can never let your guard down during the home-building process. You must always be prepared to question and verify the information you're given, even from those who are supposed to be the experts. In this case, Mike's lack of transparency and disregard for my safety turned what should have been a joyous day into a stressful and potentially hazardous one.
