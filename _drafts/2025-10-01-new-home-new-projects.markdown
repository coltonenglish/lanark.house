The first month in a new home is a whirlwind of unpacking and settling in. But it's also a great time to tackle some of those initial projects that will make your house feel like a home.

Here's a look at my to-do list for the first month:

*   **Change the locks:** This is a simple security measure that will give you peace of mind.
*   **Install window coverings:** Blinds, curtains, or shades will give you privacy and help to control the light.
*   **Organize the closets:** A good closet system will help you to stay organized and make the most of your storage space.
*   **Hang pictures and artwork:** This is a great way to personalize your space and make it feel like your own.
*   **Start planning the landscaping:** Even if you're not ready to start planting, it's a good idea to start thinking about what you want to do with your yard.

It's a lot to do, but it's also a lot of fun. Enjoy the process of making your new house a home!
