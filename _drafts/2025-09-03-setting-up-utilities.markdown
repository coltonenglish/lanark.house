Once you have the keys to your new home, there are a few things you'll need to do right away to get everything up and running. At the top of the list is setting up your utilities.

I created a checklist of all the utilities I needed to set up, including:

*   **Electricity**
*   **Gas**
*   **Water and sewer**
*   **Internet and cable**
*   **Trash and recycling**

I made sure to contact all the utility companies a few weeks before my closing date to schedule the service transfers. This helped to ensure that everything was working on the day I moved in. It's also a good idea to update your address with the post office and any other important services.
