The final walk-through is your last opportunity to inspect your new home before you take possession. It's a chance to make sure that all the work has been completed to your satisfaction and that there are no outstanding issues.

I created a detailed checklist for my final walk-through, which included:

*   **Testing all the appliances:** The dishwasher, stove, microwave, washer, and dryer.
*   **Checking all the plumbing:** Running the faucets, flushing the toilets, and looking for any leaks.
*   **Testing all the electrical:** Flipping all the switches, testing all the outlets, and checking the circuit breaker.
*   **Inspecting the finishes:** Looking for any scratches, dents, or other cosmetic flaws in the flooring, cabinets, and countertops.
*   **Making sure all the upgrades are correct:** Checking that all the finishes and upgrades you selected at the design center have been installed correctly.

Don't be afraid to be thorough. This is your new home, and you want to make sure it's perfect.
