The purchase agreement is the most important document you'll sign when buying a home. It's a legally binding contract that outlines all the terms and conditions of the sale. Before signing, I made sure to read it carefully and have my lawyer review it.

Here are some of the key sections I paid close attention to:

*   **The price and deposit structure:** When are payments due and how much?
*   **The closing date:** When do I get the keys?
*   **The list of chattels and fixtures:** What's included with the house?
*   **The conditions:** What needs to happen before the deal is firm (e.g., financing, inspection)?
*   **The warranty information:** What does the builder cover and for how long?

It's a dense document, but taking the time to understand it is essential. It's your best protection against any future misunderstandings or disputes.
