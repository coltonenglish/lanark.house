The home buying journey has taken a new turn. After deciding to move forward with a different builder, the next critical step was to secure financing. I reached out to Alex Sayidiy, a Mobile Mortgage Specialist at TD Canada Trust, to inquire about their current lending rates for new builds.

My primary goal was to understand the financial landscape and how it would impact my monthly commitments. I was particularly interested in a 30-year amortization period to keep the monthly payments as manageable as possible, even if it meant a slightly higher interest rate over the life of the loan.

The initial conversation started on May 2nd, and after a few emails to clarify my needs, Alex was able to provide a detailed quote. This marks the official beginning of the financing phase for the new property.
