The contracts were signed with a numbered alberta corporation and not with the builder's Docusign.  This means that any digital envelope (in canada this defines the document's assurance level) would not be with the recipient.  It felt as though this was structured to allow the builder to arbitrarily disclaim details as it was not the one I was signing with semantically.
