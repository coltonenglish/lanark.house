I provided my deposit cheque to Trish on November 2nd while she was boondoggling, taking forever to answer basic pricing questions.  As final pricing couldn't be determined I asked for a sample terms (void contact) so that I could familiarise myself with the contract in parallel to her delays.  It was not provided and the first time I saw the terms were were on the 47th week of 2024. 

//TODO: check when the first contract came through and update the post
